	abstract = {About predictions in spatial autoregressive models: optimal and almost optimal strategies. Spatial Economic Analysis. This paper addresses the problem of prediction in the spatial autoregressive ({SAR}) model for areal data, which is classically used in spatial econometrics. With kriging theory, prediction using the best linear unbiased predictors ({BLUPs}) is at the heart of the geostatistical literature. From a methodological point of view, we explore the limits of the extension of {BLUP} formulas in the context of {SAR} models for out-of-sample prediction simultaneously at several sites. We propose a more tractable ‘almost best’ alternative and clarify the relationship between the {BLUP} and a proper expectation–maximization ({EM}) algorithm predictor. From an empirical perspective, we present data-based simulations to compare the efficiency of classical formulas with the best and almost best predictions.},

	abstract = {Despite good progress towards elimination, malaria continues to contribute substantially to the sub-Saharan African disease burden. Sustaining previous gains requires continued readiness to deliver malaria services in response to actual disease burden, which in turn contributes to health systems strengthening. This study investigates a health system innovation. We examined whether malaria prevalence, or endemicity, is a driver of health facility readiness to deliver malaria services. To estimate this association, we geo-linked cross-sectional facility survey data to endemicity data for Kenya, Namibia and Senegal. We tested the validity and reliability of the primary study outcome, the malaria service readiness index and mapped service readiness components in a geographic information system. We conducted a weighted multivariable linear regression analysis of the relationship between endemicity and malaria service readiness, stratified for urban or rural facility location. As endemicity increased in rural areas, there was a concurrent, modest increase in service readiness at the facility level [β: 0.028; (95\% {CI} 0.008, 0.047)], whereas no relationship existed in urban settings. Private-for-profit facilities were generally less prepared than public [β: −0.102; (95\% {CI} − 0.154, −0.050)]. Most facilities had the necessary supplies to diagnose malaria, yet availability of malaria guidelines and adequately trained staff as well as medicines and commodities varied. Findings require cautious interpretation outside the study sample, which was a more limited subset of the original surveys’ sampling schemes. Our approach and findings may be used by national malaria programs to identify low performing facilities in malarious areas for targeted service delivery interventions. This study demonstrates use of existing data sources to evaluate health system performance and to identify within- and cross-country variations for targeted interventions.},

	abstract = {Background: Understanding the barriers that women in Haiti face to giving birth at a health facility is important for improving coverage of facility delivery and reducing persistently high maternal mortality. We linked health facility survey data and population survey data to assess the role of the obstetric service environment in affecting women's use of facility delivery care. Methods: Data came from the 2012 Haiti Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}) and the 2013 Haiti Service Provision Assessment ({SPA}) survey. {DHS} clusters and {SPA} facilities were linked with their geographic coordinate information. The final analysis sample from the {DHS} comprised 4,921 women who had a live birth in the 5 years preceding the survey. Service availability was measured with the number of facilities providing delivery services within a specified distance from the cluster (within 5 kilometers for urban areas and 10 kilometers for rural areas). We measured facility readiness to provide obstetric care using 37 indicators defined by the World Health Organization. Random-intercept logistic regressions were used to model the variation in individual use of facility-based delivery care and cluster-level service availability and readiness, adjusting for other factors. Results: Overall, 39\% of women delivered their most recent birth at a health facility and 61\% delivered at home, with disparities by residence (about 60\% delivered at a health facility in urban areas vs. 24\% in rural areas). About one-fifth (18\%) of women in rural areas and one-tenth (12\%) of women in nonmetropolitan urban areas lived in clusters where no facility offered delivery care within the specified distances, while nearly all women (99\%) in the metropolitan area lived in clusters that had at least 2 such facilities. Urban clusters had better service readiness compared with rural clusters, with a wide range of variation in both areas. Regression models indicated that in both rural and nonmetropolitan urban areas availability of delivery services was significantly associated with women's greater likelihood of using facility-based delivery care after controlling for other covariates, while facilities' readiness to provide delivery services was also important in nonmetropolitan urban areas. Conclusion: Increasing physical access to delivery care should become a high priority in rural Haiti. In urban areas, where delivery services are more available than in rural areas, improving quality of care at facilities could potentially lead to increased coverage of facility delivery.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an enhancement of the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method for measuring spatial accessibility, addressing the problem of uniform access within the catchment by applying weights to different travel time zones to account for distance decay. The enhancement is proved to be another special case of the gravity model. When applying this enhanced 2SFCA (E2SFCA) to measure the spatial access to primary care physicians in a study area in northern Illinois, we find that it reveals spatial accessibility pattern that is more consistent with intuition and delineates more spatially explicit health professional shortage areas. It is easy to implement in {GIS} and straightforward to interpret.},

The Service Provision Assessment ({SPA}) and Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) are the most widely employed, standardised tools that generate health service delivery data in {LMICs}. We ascertained the use of {SPA}/{SARA} surveys for assessing the quality of {MNH} services using a two-step approach: a {SPA}/{SARA} questionnaire mapping exercise in line with {WHO}'s Quality of Care ({QoC}) Framework for pregnant women and newborns and the {WHO} quality standards for care around the time of childbirth; and a scoping literature review, searching for articles that report {SPA}/{SARA} data. {SPA}/{SARA} surveys are well suited to assess the {WHO} Framework's cross-cutting dimensions (physical and human resources); {SPA} also captures elements in the provision and experience of care domains for antenatal care and family planning. Only 4 of 31 proposed {WHO} quality indicators around the time of childbirth can be fully generated using {SPA} and {SARA} surveys, while 19 and 23 quality indicators can be partially obtained from {SARA} and {SPA} surveys, respectively; most of these are input indicators. Use of {SPA}/{SARA} data is growing, but there is considerable variation in methods employed to measure {MNH} {QoC}. With {SPA}/{SARA} data available in 30 countries, {MNH} {QoC} assessments could benefit from guidance for creating standard metrics. Adding questions in {SPA}/{SARA} surveys to assess the {WHO} {QoC} Framework's provision and experience of care dimensions would fill significant data gaps in {LMICs}.},

Methods: We examined the association between {OOP} payments and quality of care during antenatal care and sick child care visits using Service Provision Assessments data. We defined four process quality outcomes from observations of clinical care: visit duration, history-taking items asked, exam items performed, and counselling items delivered. The outcome is the total amount paid for services. We used multilevel models to test the relationship between {OOP} payments and each quality measure in public, private non-profit and private for-profit facilities controlling for patient, provider, and facility characteristics. Results: Across the six countries, an average of 42\% of the 29 677 observed clients paid for their visit. In the adjusted models, {OOP} payments were positively associated with the visit duration during sick child visits, with history-taking and exam items during antenatal care visits, and with counselling in private for-profit facilities for both visit types. These associations were strong particularly in Afghanistan, the {DRC} and Haiti; for example, a high-quality antenatal care visit in the {DRC} would cost approximately {USD} 1.12 more than a visit with median quality. Conclusion: Provider effort was associated with higher {OOP} payments for sick child and antenatal care services in the six countries studied. While many families are already spending high amounts on care, they must often spend even more to receive higher quality care. © 2021 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Background
Primary care has the potential to address a large proportion of people's health needs, promote equity, and contain costs, but only if it provides high-quality health services that people want to use. 40 years after the Declaration of Alma-Ata, little is known about the quality of primary care in low-income and middle-income countries. We assessed whether existing facility surveys capture relevant aspects of primary care performance and summarised the quality of primary care in ten low-income and middle-income countries.
Methods
We used Service Provision Assessment surveys, the most comprehensive nationally representative surveys of health systems, to select indicators corresponding to three of the process quality domains (competent systems, evidence-based care, and user experience) identified by the Lancet Global Health Commission on High Quality Health Systems in the Sustainable Development Goals Era. We calculated composite and domain quality scores for first-level primary care facilities across and within ten countries with available facility assessment data (Ethiopia, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Nepal, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda).
Findings
Data were available for 7049 facilities and 63 869 care visits. There were gaps in measurement of important outcomes such as user experience, health outcomes, and confidence, and processes such as timely action, choice of provider, affordability, ease of use, dignity, privacy, non-discrimination, autonomy, and confidentiality. No information about care competence was available outside maternal and child health. Overall, scores for primary care quality were low (mean 0·41 on a scale of 0 to 1). At a domain level, scores were lowest for user experience, followed by evidence-based care, and then competent systems. At the subdomain level, scores for patient focus, prevention and detection, technical quality of sick-child care, and population-health management were lower than those for other subdomains.
Interpretation
Facility surveys do not capture key elements of primary care quality. The available measures suggest major gaps in primary care quality. If not addressed, these gaps will limit the contribution of primary care to reaching the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals.

	abstract = {Objective
To develop a composite measure of primary care quality and apply it to Haiti’s primary care system.

Methods
Using the Primary Health Care Performance Initiative’s framework, we defined four domains of primary care service delivery: (i) accessible care; (ii) effective service delivery; (iii) management and organization; and (iv) primary care functions. We gave each primary care facility in Haiti a quality score for each domain and overall, with poor, fair and good quality indicated by scores of 0.00–0.49, 0.50–0.74 and 0.75–1.00, respectively. We quantified access and effective access to primary care as the proportions of the population within 5 km of any primary care facility and a good facility, respectively.

Findings
Of the 786 primary care facilities in Haiti in 2013, only 332 (43\%) facilities were classified as good for accessible care. Fewer facilities were classified as good in the domains of effective service delivery (30; 4\%), management and organization (91; 12\%) and primary care functions (43; 5\%). Although about 91\% of the population lived within 5 km of a primary care facility, only an estimated 23\% of the entire population – including just 5\% of the rural population – had access to primary care of good quality.

Conclusion
Despite an extensive network of health facilities, a minority of Haitians had access to a primary care facility of good quality. Such facilities were especially scarce in rural areas. Similar systematic analyses of the quality of primary care could inform national efforts to strengthen health systems.},

              Non-communicable diseases and injuries ({NCDIs}) comprise a large share of mortality and morbidity in low-income countries ({LICs}), many of which occur earlier in life and with greater severity than in higher income settings. Our objective was to assess availability of essential equipment and medications required for a broad range of acute and chronic {NCDI} conditions.
            
            
              Design
              Secondary analysis of existing cross-sectional survey data.
            
            
              Setting
              We used data from Service Provision Assessment surveys in Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal and Tanzania, focusing on public first-referral level hospitals in each country.
            
            
              Outcome measures
              We defined sets of equipment and medications required for diagnosis and management of four acute and nine chronic {NCDI} conditions and determined availability of these items at the health facilities.
            
            
              Results
              Overall, 797 hospitals were included. Medication and equipment availability was highest for acute epilepsy (country estimates ranging from 40\% to 95\%) and stage 1–2 hypertension (28\%–83\%). Availability was low for type 1 diabetes (1\%–70\%), type 2 diabetes (3\%–57\%), asthma (0\%–7\%) and acute presentations of diabetes (0\%–26\%) and asthma (0\%–4\%). Few hospitals had equipment or medications for heart failure (0\%–32\%), rheumatic heart disease (0\%–23\%), hypertensive emergencies (0\%–64\%) or acute minor surgical conditions (0\%–5\%). Data for chronic pain were limited to only two countries. Availability of essential medications and equipment was lower than previous facility-reported service availability.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our findings demonstrate low availability of essential equipment and medications for diverse {NCDIs} at first-referral level hospitals in eight {LICs}. There is a need for decentralisation and integration of {NCDI} services in existing care platforms and improved assessment and monitoring to fully achieve universal health coverage.},

Main Outcome Measures: Quality indices are created as a proportion of recommended clinical actions done in observations of {ANC} and {FP} visits. We adjust the crude coverage of {ANC} and of {FP} by the quality to estimate {EC} for both services. Results: The crude coverage of {FP} was 61\% and 62\% for {ANC} in Ethiopia in 2016. On average, quality was 35.8\% during {FP} visits and 86\% of women received {\textless}50\% of the recommended clinical actions. When adjusting the crude coverage to account for the quality of service, Ethiopia’s {FP} services {EC} was 22\%.

Conclusions: The quality of both {FP} and {ANC} services is low in Ethiopia, with women obtaining only a fraction of the standard clinical actions during their visits. In addition, there is considerable variation in {EC} across Ethiopia’s regions, with variation driven largely by variations in crude coverage.

	abstract = {Objective To identify contextual factors associated with quality improvements in primary health-care facilities in the United Republic of Tanzania between two star rating assessments, focusing on local district administration and proximity to other facilities. Methods Facilities underwent star rating assessments in 2015 and between 2017 and 2018; quality was rated from zero to five stars. The consolidated framework for implementation research, adapted to a low-income context, was used to identify variables associated with star rating improvements between assessments. Facility data were obtained from several secondary sources. The proportion of the variance in facility improvement observed at facility and district levels and the influence of nearby facilities and district administration were estimated using multilevel regression models and a hierarchical spatial autoregressive model, respectively. Findings Star ratings improved at 4028 of 5595 (72\%) primary care facilities. Factors associated with improvement included: (i) star rating in 2015; (ii) facility type (e.g. hospital) and ownership (e.g. public); (iii) participation in, or eligibility for, a results-based financing programme; (iv) local population density; and (v) distance from a major road. Overall, 20\% of the variance in facility improvement was associated with district administration. Geographical clustering indicated that improvement at a facility was also associated with improvements at nearby facilities. Conclusion Although the majority of facilities improved their star rating, there were substantial variations between facilities. Both district administration and proximity to high-performing facilities influenced improvements. Quality improvement interventions should take advantage of factors operating above the facility level, such as peer learning and peer pressure. © 2020, World Health Organization.

	abstract = {Background: Health-care regionalisation, in which selected services are concentrated in higher-level facilities, has successfully improved the quality of complex medical care. However, the effectiveness of this strategy in routine maternal care is unknown. Malawi has established a national goal of halving its neonatal mortality by 2030. In this study, we aimed to assess the effect of obstetric service regionalisation in pregnant women and their newborn babies in Malawi. Methods: In this analysis, we assessed regionalisation through the use of an agent-based simulation model. We used a previously estimated utilisation function, incorporating both patient-specific and health-facility-specific characteristics, to inform patient choice. The model was validated against known utilisation patterns in Malawi. Four regionalisation scenarios were compared with the status quo: scenario 1 restricted deliveries to facilities currently capable of providing caesarean sections; scenario 2 had the same restrictions as scenario 1, but with selected facilities upgraded to provide caesarean sections; scenario 3 restricted delivery to facilities that provided five or more basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care services in the preceding 3 months; and scenario 4 had the same restrictions as scenario 3, but with selected facilities upgraded to provide at least five basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care services. We assessed neonatal mortality, utilisation, travel distance, median out-of-pocket expenditure, and proportion of women facing catastrophic expenditure. The effects of upgrading the obstetric readiness of all facilities, of removing all user fees, and of upgrading without restriction were considered in scenario analyses. Heterogeneity and parameter uncertainty were incorporated to create 95\% posterior credible intervals ({PCIs}). Findings: Scenarios restricting women to give birth in facilities with caesarean section capabilities reduced neonatal mortality by 11·4 deaths per 1000 livebirths (scenario 1; 95\% {PCI} 9·8–13·1) and 11·6 deaths per 1000 livebirths (scenario 2; 10·2–13·1), whereas scenarios restricting women to facilities that provided five or more basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care services did not affect neonatal mortality. Similarly, the caesarean section rate in Malawi, which is 4·6\% under the status quo, was predicted to rise significantly in scenario 1 (14·7\%, 95\% {PCI} 14·5–14·9; p{\textless}0·0001) and scenario 2 (10·4\%, 10·2–10·6; p{\textless}0·0001), but not in scenarios 3 and 4. Women were required to travel longer distances in scenario 1 (increase of 7·2 km, 95\% {PCI} 4·5–9·9) and in scenario 2 (4·4 km, 1·5–7·2) than in the status quo (p{\textless}0·0001). Out-of-pocket costs tripled (p{\textless}0·0001; status quo vs scenario 1 and scenario 2), and the risk of catastrophic expenditure significantly increased from a baseline of 6·4\% (95\% {PCI} 6·1–6·6) to 14·7\% (14·5–14·9) in scenario 1 and 11·3\% (11·0–11·5) in scenario 2. This increase was especially pronounced among the poor (p{\textless}0·0001; status quo vs scenario 1 and scenario 2). Interpretation: Policies restricting women to give birth in facilities with caesarean section capabilities is likely to result in significant decreases in neonatal mortality and might allow Malawi to meet its goal of halving its neonatal mortality by 2030. However, this improvement comes at the cost of increased distances to care and worsening financial risks among women.

	abstract = {In 2000, the United Nations established eight Millennium Development Goals ({MDG}) to combat worldwide poverty, disease, and lack of primary education. Goal number five aimed to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters and provide universal access to reproductive healthcare services by 2015. While there has been some progress, {MDG} 5 fell far short of target goals, highlighting the necessity of further improvement in global maternal health. Using Geographic Information Systems ({GIS}), this study aims to understand how distance to facility and quality of care, which are components of access, affect maternal service utilization in two of the world’s poorest countries, Haiti and Kenya. Furthermore, this study examines how this relationship may change or hold between urban and rural regions. Data from the United States Agency for International Development Demographic and Health Survey and Service Provision Assessment were linked spatially in a {GIS} model, drawing comparisons among distance to facility, quality of care, and maternal health service utilization. Results show that in both rural and urban regions, access to maternal health service and maternal health service utilization share a similar spatial pattern. In urban regions, pockets of maternal health disparities exist despite close distance to facility and standard quality of care. In rural regions, there are areas with long distances to facilities and low quality of care, resulting in poor maternal service usage. This study highlights the usefulness of {GIS} as a tool to evaluate disparities in maternal healthcare provision and usage.},

There is little evidence in the literature describing the status of equity in the quality of healthcare. This paper aims to understand the disparities in quality of antenatal care ({ANC}) and family planning ({FP}) among the poor and non-poor communities. We used the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}) data to compute a Multidimensional Poverty Index ({MPI}), and the 2014 Service Provision Assessment ({SPA}) data to assess quality of {ANC} and {FP} services-defined as the level of adherence to World Health Organization ({WHO}) clinical and service guidelines. We merged the two datasets using geographical coordinates, and aggregated service users into facility catchment area clusters using a 2-km radius for urban and 10-km radius for rural facilities. We computed {ANC} and {FP} quality and {MPI} indices for each facility and assigned these to catchment areas. Using the international cutoff point for deprivation ({MPI} = 33.3\%), we evaluated whether the quality of {ANC} and {FP} services varies by poor and non-poor catchment areas. We found that most of catchment areas (75.7\%) were deprived. While the overall quality of {ANC} and {FP} services are low (33\% and 34\% respectively), we found little variation in the distribution of the quality of these services between poor and nonpoor areas, urban and rural settings, or regionally. The short-term focus needs to be on improving the overall quality of services rather than on its distribution.},

	abstract = {Monitoring subnational healthcare quality is important for identifying and addressing geographic inequities. Yet, health facility surveys are rarely powered to support the generation of estimates at more local levels. With this study, we propose an analytical approach for estimating both temporal and subnational patterns of healthcare quality indicators from health facility survey data. This method uses random effects to account for differences between survey instruments; space-time processes to leverage correlations in space and time; and covariates to incorporate auxiliary information. We applied this method for three countries in which at least four health facility surveys had been conducted since 1999 - Kenya, Senegal, and Tanzania - and estimated measures of sick-child care quality per {WHO} Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) guidelines at programmatic subnational level, between 1999 and 2020. Model performance metrics indicated good out-of-sample predictive validity, illustrating the potential utility of geospatial statistical models for health facility data. This method offers a way to jointly estimate indicators of healthcare quality over space and time, which could then provide insights to decision-makers and health service program managers. Here, authors present an approach to assess subnational healthcare quality, leveraging health facility survey data. The method jointly estimates indicators over space and time, and may provide insights to decision-makers and health service program managers.},

	abstract = {Objectives Despite significant progress in childhood vaccination coverage globally, substantial inequality remains. Remote rural populations are recognised as a priority group for immunisation service equity. We aimed to link facility and individual data to examine the relationship between distance to services and immunisation coverage empirically, specifically using a rural population. Design and setting Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of facility data from the 2013-2014 Malawi Service Provision Assessment and individual data from the 2015-2016 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey, linking children to facilities within a 5 km radius. We examined associations between proximity to health facilities and vaccination receipt via bivariate comparisons and logistic regression models. Participants 2740 children aged 12-23 months living in rural areas. Outcome measures Immunisation coverage for the six vaccines included in the Malawi Expanded Programme on Immunization schedule for children under 1 year at time of study, as well as two composite vaccination indicators (receipt of basic vaccines and receipt of all recommended vaccines), zero-dose pentavalent coverage, and pentavalent dropout. Findings 72\% (706/977) of facilities offered childhood vaccination services. Among children in rural areas, 61\% were proximal to (within 5 km of) a vaccine-providing facility. Proximity to a vaccine-providing health facility was associated with increased likelihood of having received the rotavirus vaccine (93\% vs 88\%, p=0.004) and measles vaccine (93\% vs 89\%, p=0.01) in bivariate tests. In adjusted comparisons, how close a child was to a health facility remained meaningfully associated with how likely they were to have received rotavirus vaccine (adjusted {OR} ({AOR}) 1.63, 95\% {CI} 1.13 to 2.33) and measles vaccine ({AOR} 1.62, 95\% {CI} 1.11 to 2.37). Conclusion Proximity to health facilities was significantly associated with likelihood of receipt for some, but not all, vaccines. Our findings reiterate the vulnerability of children residing far from static vaccination services; efforts that specifically target remote rural populations living far from health facilities are warranted to ensure equitable vaccination coverage.},

This study incorporates innovative technological advances to overcome methodological shortcomings in existing studies. We contrast live interviewers with "virtual" interviewers, using a computer-assisted self-interviewing system that displays digital videos of interviewers. We administered a series of survey items on race and race-related issues to both African American and white respondents, using both black and white interviewers, in a controlled laboratory setting. Results varied by question topic. Where effects occurred, African Americans provided less liberal racial attitudes to white interviewers in both the live and the virtual condition. For some categories of questions, however, whites gave more racially conservative responses to the virtual black interviewer than to the virtual white interviewer; this suggests an effect of stereotype activation rather than of social presence.},

The purpose is to stimulate debate and initiate action that leads to an improved quality of model development and evaluation, so increasing the capacity for models to have positive outcomes from their use. As such, we emphasize the relationship between the model evaluation process and credibility with stakeholders (including funding agencies) with a view to ensure continued support for modelling efforts. Many journals, including {EM}\&S, publish the results of environmental modelling studies and must judge the work and the submitted papers based solely on the material that the authors have chosen to present and on how they present it. There is considerable variation in how this is done with the consequent risk of considerable variation in the quality and usefulness of the resulting publication. Part of the problem is that the review process is reactive, responding to the submitted manuscript. In this letter, we attempt to be proactive and give guidelines for researchers, authors and reviewers as to what constitutes best practice in presenting environmental modelling results. This is a unique contribution to the organisation and practice of model-based research and the communication of its results that will benefit the entire environmental modelling community. For a start, our view is that the community of environmental modellers should have a common vision of minimum standards that an environmental model must meet. A common vision of what a good model should be is expressed in various guidelines on Good Modelling Practice. The guidelines prompt modellers to codify their practice and to be more rigorous in their model testing. Our statement within this letter deals with another aspect of the issue – it prompts professional journals to codify the peer-review process. Introducing a more formalized approach to peer-review may discourage reviewers from accepting invitations to review given the additional time and labour requirements. The burden of proving model credibility is thus shifted to the authors. Here we discuss how to reduce this burden by selecting realistic evaluation criteria and conclude by advocating the use of standardized evaluation tools as this is a key issue that needs to be tackled.},

	abstract = {Universal access to health care requires service availability and accessibility for those most in need of maternal and child health services. Women often bypass facilities closest to home due to poor quality. Few studies have directly linked individuals to facilities where they sought maternal and child health services and examined the role of distance and quality on this facility choice. Using endline data from a longitudinal survey from a sample of women in five cities in Kenya, we examine the role of distance and quality on facility selection for women using delivery, facility-based contraceptives, and child health services. A survey of public and private facilities offering reproductive health services was also conducted. Distances were measured between household cluster location and both the nearest facility and facility where women sought care. A quality index score representing facility infrastructure, staff, and supply characteristics was assigned to each facility. We use descriptive statistics to compare distance and quality between the nearest available facility and visited facility among women who bypassed the nearest facility. Facility distance and quality comparisons were also stratified by poverty status. Logistic regression models were used to measure associations between the quality and distance to the nearest facility and bypassing for each outcome. The majority of women bypassed the nearest facility regardless of service sought. Women bypassing for delivery traveled the furthest and had the fewest facility options near their residential cluster. Poor women bypassing for delivery traveled 4.5 km further than non-poor women. Among women who bypassed, two thirds seeking delivery and approximately 46\% seeking facility-based contraception or child health services bypassed to a public hospital. Both poor and non-poor women bypassed to higher quality facilities. Our findings suggest that women in five cities in Kenya prefer public hospitals and are willing to travel further to obtain services at public hospitals, possibly related to free service availability. Over time, it will be important to examine service quality and availability in public sector facilities with reduced or eliminated user fees, and whether it lends itself to a continuum of care where women can visit one facility for multiple services reducing travel burden.},

A main cause is the deep disparities in access to care and health outcomes. Federal programs such as the designations of Medically Underserved Areas/Populations and Health Professional Shortage Areas are designed to boost the number of health professionals serving these areas and to help alleviate the access problem. Their effectiveness relies first and foremost on an accurate measure of accessibility so that resources can be allocated to truly needy areas. Various measures of accessibility need to be integrated into one framework for comparison and evaluation. Optimization methods can be used to improve the distribution and supply of health care providers to maximize service coverage, minimize travel needs of patients, limit the number of facilities, and maximize health or access equality. Inequality in health care access comes at a personal and societal price, evidenced in disparities in health outcomes, including late-stage cancer diagnosis. This review surveys recent literature on the three named issues with emphasis on methodological advancements and implications for public policy.},

	abstract = {Background. The health care a woman receives during pregnancy is important for her survival and baby, both at the time of delivery and shortly after that. In the context of high maternal morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, fewer than 80\% of pregnant women receive antenatal care visit services. Receiving antenatal care visits at least four times increases the likelihood of receiving effective maternal health interventions through the antenatal period. This study aimed to identify the utilization and determinants of attending at least four visits in 12 East African countries. Methods. The study used the demographic and health survey data from 12 East African countries from 2008 to 2018. The {DHS} program adopts standardized methods involving uniform questionnaires, manuals, and field procedures to gather information comparable across countries globally. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify the determinants of completing at least four antenatal care services. With their 95\% {CI} obtained from the adjusted multilevel logistic regression model, the adjusted odds ratio was presented to show the magnitude of the relationship between the independent variable and completing antenatal care visits. Results. The pooled utilization of attending at least four antenatal care visit in the East African region was 52.44\% (95\% {CI}: 52.13, 52.74), with the highest attending at least four or more antenatal care visit visits in Zimbabwe (75.72\%) and the lowest attending at least four or more antenatal care visit visits in Ethiopia (31.82\%). The significant determinants of completing at least four {ANC} visits were age category (24–34 ({AOR} = 1.24, 95\% {CI}: 1.18, 1.31) and 35–49 ({AOR} = 1.42, 95\% {CI}: 1.32, 1.53)); being married women ({AOR} = 1.11, 95\% {CI}: 1.1.05, 1.16); education levels of primary education ({AOR} = 1.20, 95\% {CI}: 1.13, 1.27), secondary education ({AOR} = 1.24, 95\% {CI}: 1.24, 1.47), and higher education ({AOR} = 1.91, 95\% {CI}: 1.62, 2.14); birth order (2–4 ({AOR} = 0.75, 95\% {CI}: 0.70, 0.79) and 5+ ({AOR} = 0.63, 95\% {CI}: 0.58, 0.68)); planned pregnancy ({AOR} = 0.81, 95\% {CI}: 0.75, 0.86); contraceptive utilization ({AOR} = 1.36, 95\% {CI}: 1.29, 1.43); wealth status of middle ({AOR} = 1.11, 95\% {CI}: 1.05, 1.17) and rich ({AOR} = 1.25, 95\% {CI}: 1.18, 1.32); having no problem accessing health care ({AOR} = 1.0.95, 95\% {CI}: 0.89, 0.97); and living countries. Conclusions. The coverage of completing the recommended antenatal care visit was low in the region. Age, marital status, mother’s and partner’s education, women’s occupation, birth order, planned pregnancy, contraceptive utilization, wealth status, healthcare accessibility, and living countries were the major determinants of completing recommended antenatal care visits. Therefore, intersectoral collaboration to promote female education and empowerment, improve geographical access to health care, and strengthen implementation of antenatal care policies with active community participation is recommended. In addition, creating a conducive environment in entrepreneurial activities for poor women is needed.},

Ghana initiated a self-assessment process to understand the functionality of districts to deliver on health results. The assessment was conducted by health managers in 33 districts during August–October 2022 using tools pre-developed by the World Health Organization. Functionality was explored around service provision, oversight, and management capacities, each with defined dimensions and attributes. The objective of the study was to highlight specific functionality improvements needed by districts in terms of investments and access to service delivery in achieving Universal Health Care. The results showed a lack of correlation between functionality and performance as is currently defined in Ghana; a higher functionality of oversight capacity compared to service provision or management capacities; and specifically low functionality for dimensions relating to capacity to make available quality services, responsiveness to beneficiaries and the systems and three structures for health management. The findings highlight the need to shift from quantitative outcome indicator-based performance approaches to measures of total health and wellbeing of beneficiaries. Specific functionality improvements are needed to improve the engagement and answerability to the beneficiaries, investments in access to services, and in building management architecture.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Despite national efforts to integrate Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission ({PMTCT}) of {HIV} services into antenatal care in Indonesia, the rate of mother-to-child transmission of {HIV} remains the highest in the world. A range of barriers to uptake and long-term engagement in care have been identified, but far less is known about health system preparedness to deliver {PMTCT} of {HIV} services. This study explored supply-side barriers to the delivery of {PMTCT} services in Indonesia and whether these factors are associated with the uptake of antenatal {HIV} testing.
            
            
              Materials and methods
              An ecological analysis was undertaken, linking data from the World Bank Quality Service and Delivery Survey (2016) with routine data from Indonesia’s {HIV} and {AIDS} case surveillance system and district health profile reports (2016). Supply-side readiness scores—generated from a readiness index that measures overall structural capacity and is often used as proxy for quality of care—were adapted from the {WHO} Service Availability and Readiness Assessment and presented by sector and geographic area. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to explore factors associated with the uptake of antenatal {HIV} testing in public facilities.
            
            
              Results
              In general, public facilities scored more highly in most inputs compared to private facilities. Facilities located in urban areas also scored more highly in the majority of inputs compared to ones in rural areas. Readiness scores were lowest for {PMTCT} services compared to Antenatal Care and {HIV} Care and Support services, especially for the availability of medicines such as zidovudine and nevirapine. The national composite readiness score for {PMTCT} was only 0.13 (based on a maximum score of 1) with a composite score of 0.21 for public facilities and 0.06 for private facilities. The multivariate analysis shows that the proportion of pregnant women tested for {HIV} was more likely to be greater than or equal to 10\% in facilities with a higher readiness score and a higher number of trained counsellors available, and less likely in facilities located outside of Java-Bali and in facilities supporting a higher number of village midwives.
            
            
              Discussion
              Despite targeted efforts by the Indonesian government and multinational agencies, significant gaps exist in the delivery of {PMTCT} that compromise the standard of care delivered in Indonesia. Future strategies should focus on improving the availability of tests and treatment, especially in the private sector and in rural areas.},

              Background
              The rapid rise of non-communicable diseases ({NCDs}) has become a significant public health concern in Bangladesh. This study assesses the readiness of primary healthcare facilities to manage the following {NCDs}: diabetes mellitus ({DM}), cervical cancer, chronic respiratory diseases ({CRIs}), and cardiovascular diseases ({CVDs}).
            
            
              Methods
              A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May 2021 and October 2021 among 126 public and private primary healthcare facilities (nine Upazila health complexes ({UHCs}), 36 union-level facilities ({ULFs}), 53 community clinics ({CCs}), and 28 private hospitals/clinics). The {NCD}-specific service readiness was assessed using the World Health Organization’s ({WHO}) Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) reference manual. The facilities’ readiness was assessed using the following four domains: guidelines and staff, basic equipment, diagnostic facility, and essential medicine. The mean readiness index ({RI}) score for each domain was calculated. Facilities with {RI} scores of above 70\% were considered ‘ready’ to manage {NCDs}.
            
            
              Results
              The general services availability ranged between 47\% for {CCs} and 83\% for {UHCs} and the guidelines and staff accessibility were the highest for {DM} in the {UHCs} (72\%); however, cervical cancer services were unavailable in the {ULFs} and {CCs}. The availability of basic equipment was the highest for cervical cancer (100\%) in the {UHCs} and the lowest for {DM} (24\%) in the {ULFs}. The essential medicine for {CRI} was 100\% in both {UHCs} and {ULFs} compared to 25\% in private facilities. The diagnostic capacity for {CVD} and essential medicine for cervical cancer was unavailable at all levels of public and private healthcare facilities. The overall mean {RI} for each of the four {NCDs} was below the cut-off value of 70\%, with the highest (65\%) for {CRI} in {UHCs} but unavailable for cervical cancer in {CCs}.
            
            
              Conclusion
              All levels of primary healthcare facilities are currently not ready to manage {NCDs}. The notable deficits were the shortage of trained staff and guidelines, diagnostic facilities, and essential medicine. This study recommends increasing service availability to address the rising burden of {NCDs} at primary healthcare levels in Bangladesh.},

A secondary analysis was conducted using the 2014 and 2016 Senegal’s Service Provision Assessment. The study sample consists of 1076 antenatal care across 369 health facilities. Multiple logit regression models were used to estimate the probability of receiving {IPTp}-{SP} during the antenatal care visit based on prior receipt of {IPTp}-{SP} and gestational age during the current pregnancy. At an antenatal care visit, the probability of receiving {IPTp}-{SP} is 84\% (95\% {CI} = [83\%, 86\%]) among women with no {IPTp}-{SP} history and 85\% (95\% {CI} = [79\%, 92\%]) among women with one prior dose. Women who visit a facility in the top quintile of the proportion of {IPTp} trained staff have a nearly 4-fold higher odds of receiving {IPTp} compared to those who visit a facility in the bottom quintile (95\% {CI} = [1.54, 9.80]). The dose and timing of {IPTp}-{SP} provided in antenatal care settings in Senegal did not always conform with the national guideline.

              Backgrounds
              The increasing burden of cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) has become a major challenge globally, including in Indonesia. Understanding the readiness of primary health care facilities is necessary to confront the challenge of providing access to quality {CVD} health care services. Our study aimed to provide information regarding readiness to deliver {CVD} health services in public primary health care namely Puskesmas.
            
            
              Methods
              
                The study questionnaire was adapted from the World Health Organization ({WHO}) Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}), modified based on the package of essentials for non-communicable disease ({PEN}) and the Indonesian Ministry of health regulation. Data were collected from all Puskesmas facilities (
                N
                 = 47) located in Makassar city. We analysed relevant data following the {WHO}-{SARA} manual to assess the readiness of Puskesmas to deliver {CVD} services. Human resources, diagnostic capacity, supporting equipment, essential medication, infrastructure and guidelines, and ambulatory services domain were assessed based on the availability of each tracer item in a particular domain. The mean domain score was calculated based on the availability of tracer items within each domain. Furthermore, the means of all domains’ scores are expressed as an overall readiness index. Higher scores indicate greater readiness of Puskesmas to deliver {CVD}-related health care.
              
            
            
              Results
              Puskesmas delivers health promotion, disease prevention, and prompt diagnosis for cardiovascular-related diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease ({CHD}), and stroke. Meanwhile, basic treatments were observed in the majority of the Puskesmas. Long-term care for hypertension and diabetes patients and rehabilitation for {CHD} and stroke were only observed in a few Puskesmas. The readiness score of Puskesmas to deliver {CVD} health care ranged from 60 to 86 for. Furthermore, there were 11 Puskesmas (23.4\%) with a score below 75, indicating a sub-optimal readiness for delivering {CVD} health services. A shortage of essential medicines and a low capacity for diagnostic testing were the most noticeable shortcomings leading to suboptimal readiness for high-quality {CVD} health services.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Close cooperation with the government and other related stakeholders is required to tackle the identified shortcomings, especially the continuous monitoring of adequate supplies of medicines and diagnostic tools to achieve better {CVD} care for patients in Indonesia.},

              Background
              Most pregnant women in low and lower-middle-income countries do not receive all components of antenatal care ({ANC}), including counselling on obstetric danger signs. Facility-level {ANC} guidelines and provider in-service training are major factors influencing {ANC} counselling. In Ethiopia, little is known about the extent to which guidelines and provider in-service training can increase the quality of {ANC} counselling.
            
            
              Methods
              We examined the effect of national {ANC} guidelines and {ANC} provider in-service training on obstetric danger sign counselling for pregnant women receiving {ANC} using the 2014 Ethiopian service provision assessment plus ({ESPA} +) survey data. We created two analysis samples by applying a propensity score matching method. The first sample consisted of women who received {ANC} at health facilities with guidelines matched with those who received {ANC} at health facilities without guidelines. The second sample consisted of women who received {ANC} from the providers who had undertaken in-service training in the last 24 months matched with women who received {ANC} from untrained providers. The outcome variable was the number of obstetric danger signs described during {ANC} counselling, ranging from zero to eight. The covariates included women’s socio-demographic characteristics, obstetric history, health facility characteristics, and {ANC} provider characteristics.
            
            
              Results
              We found that counselling women about obstetric danger signs during their {ANC} session varied according to the availability of {ANC} guidelines (61\% to 70\%) and provider training (62\% to 68\%). After matching the study participants by the measured covariates, the availability of {ANC} guidelines at the facility level significantly increased the average number of obstetric danger signs women received during counselling by 24\% (95\% {CI}: 12–35\%). Similarly, providing refresher training for {ANC} providers increased the average number of obstetric danger signs described during counselling by 37\% (95\% {CI}: 26–48\%).
            
            
              Conclusion
              The findings suggest that the quality of {ANC} counselling in Ethiopia needs strengthening by ensuring that {ANC} guidelines are available at every health facility and that the providers receive regular {ANC} related in-service training.},

Currently, it contributes to 67\% of annual deaths, and accounts for approximately 64\% of the disease burden. Since 70\% of the Bangladeshi population residing in the rural area rely on the primary healthcare system, assessment of its capacity is crucial for guiding public health decisions to prevent and manage {NCDs}. This protocol is designed to recognise and assess the Bangladeshi health system's readiness for {NCDs} at the primary level. Methods and analysis The study will use a mixed-method design. Numerical data will be collected using households and health facilities surveys, while qualitative data will be collected by interviewing healthcare providers, policy planners, health administrators and community members. The {WHO}'s Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) methodology and Package of Essential Non-communicable ({PEN}) Disease Interventions for Primary Healthcare reference manuals will be used to assess the readiness of the primary healthcare facilities for {NCD} services. Furthermore, Health System Dynamics Framework will be used to examine health system factors. Using the supportive items outlined in the {WHO} {PEN} package, and indicators proposed in {WHO} {SARA} methodology, a composite score will be created to analyse facility-level data. Two independent samples t-test, analysis of variance and chi(2) test methods will be used for bivariate analysis, and multiple regression analysis will be used for multivariable analysis. Complementarily, the thematic analysis approach will be used to analyse qualitative data. Ethics and dissemination The project has been approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (Project {ID}: 27112), and Bangladesh Medical Research Council (Ref: {BMRC}/{NREC}/2019-2022/270). The research findings will be shared through research articles, conference proceedings or in other scientific media. The reports or publications will not have any information that can be used to identify any of the study participants.},

              Background
              The monitoring framework for evaluating health system response to noncommunicable diseases ({NCDs}) include indicators to assess availability of affordable basic technologies and essential medicines to treat them in both public and private primary care facilities. The Government of India launched the National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke ({NPCDCS}) in 2010 to strengthen health systems. We assessed availability of trained human resources, essential medicines and technologies for diabetes, cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases as one of the components of the National Noncommunicable Disease Monitoring Survey ({NNMS} - 2017-18).
            
            
              Methods
              {NNMS} was a cross-sectional survey. Health facility survey component covered three public [Primary health centre ({PHC}), Community health centre ({CHC}) and District hospital ({DH})] and one private primary in each of the 600 primary sampling units ({PSUs}) selected by stratified multistage random sampling to be nationally representative. Survey teams interviewed medical officers, laboratory technicians, and pharmacists using an adapted World Health Organization ({WHO}) – Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) tool on handhelds with Open Data Kit ({ODK}) technology. List of essential medicines and technology was according to {WHO} - Package of Essential Medicines and Technologies for {NCDs} ({PEN}) and {NPCDCS} guidelines for primary and secondary facilities, respectively. Availability was defined as reported to be generally available within facility premises.
            
            
              Results
              Total of 537 public and 512 private primary facilities, 386 {CHCs} and 334 {DHs} across India were covered. {NPCDCS} was being implemented in 72.8\% of {CHCs} and 86.8\% of {DHs}. All essential technologies and medicines available to manage three {NCDs} in primary care varied between 1.1\% (95\% {CI}; 0.3–3.3) in rural public to 9.0\% (95\% {CI}; 6.2–13.0) in urban private facilities. In {NPCDCS} implementing districts, 0.4\% of {CHCs} and 14.5\% of the {DHs} were fully equipped. {DHs} were well staffed, {CHCs} had deficits in physiotherapist and specialist positions, whereas {PHCs} reported shortage of nurse-midwives and health assistants. Training under {NPCDCS} was uniformly poor across all facilities.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Both private and public primary care facilities and public secondary facilities are currently not adequately prepared to comprehensively address the burden of {NCDs} in India.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Chronic lung diseases ({CLDs}), responsible for 4 million deaths globally every year, are increasingly important in low- and middle-income countries where most of the global mortality due to {CLDs} currently occurs. As existing health systems in resource-poor contexts, especially sub-Saharan Africa ({SSA}), are not generally oriented to provide quality care for chronic diseases, a first step in re-imagining them is to critically consider readiness for service delivery across all aspects of the existing system.
            
            
              Methods
              We conducted a mixed-methods assessment of {CLD} service readiness in 18 purposively selected health facilities in two differing {SSA} health system contexts, Tanzania and Sudan. We used the World Health Organization’s ({WHO}) Service Availability and Readiness Assessment checklist, qualitative interviews of key health system stakeholders, health facility registers review and assessed clinicians’ capacity to manage {CLD} using patient vignettes. {CLD} service readiness was scored as a composite of availability of service-specific tracer items from the {WHO} service availability checklist in three domains: staff training and guidelines, diagnostics and equipment, and basic medicines. Qualitative data were analysed using the same domains.
            
            
              Results
              One health facility in Tanzania and five in Sudan, attained a {CLD} readiness score of ≥ 50 \% for {CLD} care. Scores ranged from 14.9 \% in a dispensary to 53.3 \% in a health center in Tanzania, and from 36.4 to 86.4 \% in Sudan. The least available tracer items across both countries were trained human resources and guidelines, and peak flow meters. Only two facilities had {COPD} guidelines. Patient vignette analysis revealed significant gaps in clinicians’ capacity to manage {CLD}. Key informants identified low prioritization as key barrier to {CLD} care.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Gaps in service availability and readiness for {CLD} care in Tanzania and Sudan threaten attainment of universal health coverage in these settings. Detailed assessments by health systems researchers in discussion with stakeholders at all levels of the health system can identify critical blockages to reimagining {CLD} service provision with people-centered, integrated approaches at its heart.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Double disease burden such as Tuberculosis and Diabetes mellitus comorbidity is evident and on rising especially in high burden settings such as Tanzania. There is limited information about the availability of tuberculosis/diabetes integrated healthcare services in Tanzania. Therefore, this study explored the availability and examined the readiness of healthcare facilities with tuberculosis services to manage diabetes mellitus in Tanzania.
            
            
              Methods
              We abstracted data from the 2014–2015 Tanzania Service Provision Assessment Survey datasets. The service availability was assessed by calculating the proportion of tuberculosis facilities reported to manage diabetes mellitus. There were four domains; each domain with some indicators for calculating the readiness index. High readiness was considered if the tuberculosis facilities scored at least half (≥50\%) of the indicators listed in each of the four domains (staff training and guideline, diagnostics, equipment, and medicines) as is recommended by the World Health Organization-Service Availability and Readiness Assessment manual while low readiness for otherwise.
            
            
              Results
              Out of 341 healthcare facilities with tuberculosis services included in the current study, 238 (70.0\%) reported providing management for diabetes mellitus. The majority of the facilities were dispensaries and clinics 48.1\%; publicly owned 72.6\%; and located in rural 62.6\%. Overall, the readiness of tuberculosis facilities to manage diabetes was low (10.8\%). Similarly, the readiness was low based on the domain-specific readiness of trained staff and guidelines.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Although the majority of the healthcare facilities with tuberculosis services had diabetes mellitus services the overall readiness was low. This finding provides a piece of evidence to inform the policymakers in high burden and low resource countries to strengthen the co-management of tuberculosis and diabetes.},

However, this effect was not consistent across studies. Some studies reported that geographic access to obstetric care facilities had no influence on the use of facility delivery. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized and pooled the influence of geographic access on institutional delivery service uptake in low and middle-income countries. Methods Multiple combinations of search terms were used to search articles from six databases and a hand search of reference lists performed. We included observational studies conducted in low and middle-income countries which reported the influence of geographic access on delivery care use. The pooled effects of geographic access on institutional delivery care use were calculated using a random-effects model with a 95\% confidence interval. Findings In this study a total of 31 studies were included. Among these studies, 15 met criteria for inclusion in the meta-analyses, while the remaining 16 were summarized using qualitative synthesis. Studies included in the analysis where women had to walk 60 minutes or less to access a health facility delivery were significantly heterogeneous. Having access to obstetric care facilities within five kilometres was significantly associated with institutional deliveries (pooled {OR} = 2.27; 95\% {CI} = 1.82, 2.82). Similarly, a travelling time of 60 minutes or less was significantly associated with higher odds of health facility delivery (pooled {OR} = 3.30; 95\% {CI} = 1.97, 5.53). Every one-hour and one-kilometre increase in travel time and distance, respectively, was negatively associated with institutional delivery care use. Interpretation Geographic access measured in either physical distance and/or travel time was significantly associated with women’s use of facility delivery. The greater the distance and/or travel time to obstetric care facilities, the greater the barrier and the lesser the service uptake.},

              Design
              Facility-based cross-sectional survey.
            
            
              Setting
              This study analysed data collected from public and private-owned dispensaries/clinics, health centres and hospitals during the 2014–2015 Tanzania Service Provision Assessment survey.
            
            
              Primary outcome measures
              Three outcome variables are included in this study, namely readiness of facilities to provide outpatient management for diabetes, hypertension and chronic respiratory diseases. These were composite variables measured based on availability of indicators identified in the {WHO}-Service Availability and Readiness Assessment manual. These indicators were grouped into three domains, viz staff training and guidelines, basic diagnostic equipment and basic medicines. Readiness was measured by assessing the presence of required indicators in each of these domains.
            
            
              Results
              Out of 1188 health facilities assessed, 52.1\%, 64.8\% and 60.9\% reported providing services related to diabetes, hypertension and chronic respiratory diseases, respectively. A few facilities reported having treatment guidelines (33.2\%) or staff trained to provide non-communicable disease services (10.4\%). The availability of basic diagnostic equipment and medicines for these diseases was significantly lower in public lower level facilities than in their private counterparts (p{\textless}0.05). Facilities located in urban settings as well as higher level (health centre and hospitals) and publicly owned facilities were significantly associated with increased service readiness index for providing outpatient management of non-communicable diseases.
            
            
              Conclusion
              A fair distribution of resources through the ‘push’ system of refresher training, treatment guidelines, medicines and diagnostic equipment from higher authorities or other agencies may be one way of strengthening the readiness of lower level and public facilities to cope with the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases in low-resource countries such as Tanzania.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Access to energy is essential for resilient health systems; however, strengthening energy infrastructure in rural health facilities remains a challenge. In 2015–19, ‘Powering Healthcare’ deployed solar energy solutions to off-grid rural health facilities in Ghana and Uganda to improve the availability of maternal and child health services. To explore the links between health facility electrification and service availability and use, the World Health Organization ({WHO}), in partnership with Dodowa Health Research Centre and Makerere University School of Public Health, carried out an implementation research study. The objectives of this study were to (1) capture changes in service availability and readiness, (2) describe changes in community satisfaction and use and (3) examine the implementation factors of sustainable electrification that affect these changes. Data were collected through interviews with over 100 key informants, focus group discussions with over 800 community members and health facility assessment checklist adapted from the {WHO}’s Service Availability and Readiness Assessment tool. Implementation factors were organized using Normalization Process Theory constructs. The study found that access to energy is associated with increased availability of health services, access to communication technologies, appropriate storage of vaccines and medicines, enhanced health worker motivation and increased community satisfaction. Implementation factors associated with improved outcomes include stakeholder engagement activities to promote internalization, provision of materials and information to encourage participation, and establishment of relationships to support integration. Barriers to achieving outcomes are primarily health systems challenges—such as drug stockouts, lack of transportation and poor amenities—that continue to affect service availability, readiness and use, even where access to energy is available. However, through appropriate implementation and integration of sustainable electrification, strengthened energy infrastructure can be leveraged to catalyze investment in other components of functioning health systems. Improving access to energy in health facilities is, therefore, necessary but not sufficient for strengthening health systems.},

              Background
              The burgeoning rise of non-communicable diseases ({NCDs}) is posing serious challenges in resource constrained health facilities of Nepal. The main objective of this study was to assess the readiness of health facilities for cardiovascular diseases ({CVDs}), diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases ({CRDs}) services in Nepal.
            
            
              Methods
              This study utilized data from the Nepal Health Facility Survey 2015. General readiness of 940 health facilities along with disease specific readiness for {CVDs}, diabetes, and {CRDs} were assessed using the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment manual of the World Health Organization. Health facilities were categorized into public and private facilities.
            
            
              Results
              Out of a total of 940 health facilities assessed, private facilities showed higher availability of items of general service readiness except for standard precautions for infection prevention, compared to public facilities. The multivariable adjusted regression coefficients for {CVDs} (β = 2.87, 95\%{CI}: 2.42–3.39), diabetes (β =3.02, 95\%{CI}: 2.03–4.49), and {CRDs} (β = 15.95, 95\%{CI}: 4.61–55.13) at private facilities were higher than the public facilities. Health facilities located in the hills had a higher readiness index for {CVDs} (β = 1.99, 95\%{CI}: 1.02–1.39). Service readiness for {CVDs} (β = 1.13, 95\%{CI}: 1.04–1.23) and diabetes (β = 1.78, 95\%{CI}: 1.23–2.59) were higher in the urban municipalities than in rural municipalities. Finally, disease-related services readiness index was sub-optimal with some degree of variation at the province level in Nepal. Compared to province 1, province 2 (β = 0.83, 95\%{CI}: 0.73–0.95) had lower, and province 4 (β =1.24, 95\%{CI}: 1.07–1.43) and province 5 (β =1.17, 95\%{CI}: 1.02–1.34) had higher readiness index for {CVDs}.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This study found sub-optimal readiness of services related to three {NCDs} at the public facilities in Nepal. Compared to public facilities, private facilities showed higher readiness scores for {CVDs}, diabetes, and {CRDs}. There is an urgent need for policy reform to improve the health services for {NCDs}, particularly in public facilities.},

	abstract = {In Vietnam, the overall prevalence of hypertension ({HTN}) was 21\%, with lower estimates for the prevalence of {HTN} awareness and treatment. The health systems, like other low-and middle-income countries, were designed to provide acute care for episodic conditions, rather than a chronic condition where patients need long-term care across time and disciplines. This article describes the delivery and organization of {HTN} care at primary healthcare ({PHC}) settings in both urban and rural areas at Hue Province of Central Vietnam in comparison with Thai Nguyen province in Northern Vietnam based on the infrastructure capacity and patients' and providers' perspectives and experiences We used mixed-methods design that included in-depth semi-structured interviews with patients and healthcare providers at purposively selected {PHC} facilities in two districts of each province and a modified version of the service availability and readiness assessment inventory at all {PHC} facilities. We found that {HTN} patients in both provinces can access healthcare services to diagnose, treat and control their {HTN} condition at the {PHC} level with a focus on district facilities. Health services in Hue have allowed commune health stations ({CHSs}) to provide routine monitoring and prescription refills for {HTN} patients while maintaining periodical visits to a higher level of care to monitor the stability of the disease. Such provision of care at {CHSs} remained restricted in Thai Nguyen. Further improvements are necessary for referral procedures, information system to allow for longitudinal follow-up across levels of care and defining a basic health insurance or benefits package, which meets patients' preferences with a monthly timespan for prescription refills.},

              Background
              According to the Donabedian model, the assessment for the quality of care includes three dimensions. These are structure, process, and outcome. Therefore, the present study aimed at assessing the structural quality of Antenatal care ({ANC}) service provision in Ethiopian health facilities.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Data were obtained from the 2018 Ethiopian Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) survey. The {SARA} was a cross-sectional facility-based assessment conducted to capture health facility service availability and readiness in Ethiopia. A total of 764 health facilities were sampled in the 9 regions and 2 city administrations of the country. The availability of equipment, supplies, medicine, health worker’s training and availability of guidelines were assessed. Data were collected from October–December 2017. We run a multiple linear regression model to identify predictors of health facility readiness for Antenatal care service. The level of significance was determined at a
                p
                -value {\textless} 0.05.
              
            
            
              Result
              
                Among the selected health facilities, 80.5\% of them offered Antenatal care service. However, the availability of specific services was very low. The availability of tetanus toxoid vaccination, folic acid, iron supplementation, and monitoring of hypertension disorder was, 67.7, 65.6, 68.6, and 75.1\%, respectively. The overall mean availability among the ten tracer items that are necessary to provide quality Antenatal care services was 50\%. In the multiple linear regression model, health centers, health posts and clinics scored lower Antenatal care service readiness compared to hospitals. The overall readiness index score was lower for private health facilities (β = − 0.047, 95\% {CI}: (− 0.1, − 0.004). The readiness score had no association with the facility settings (Urban/Rural) (
                p
                -value {\textgreater} 0.05). Facilities in six regions except Dire Dawa had (β = 0.067, 95\% {CI}: (0.004, 0.129) lower readiness score than facilities in Tigray region (
                p
                -value {\textless} 0.015).
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              This analysis provides evidence of the gaps in structural readiness of health facilities to provide quality Antenatal care services. Key and essential supplies for quality Antenatal care service provision were missed in many of the health facilities. Guaranteeing properly equipped and staffed facilities shall be a target to improve the quality of Antenatal care services provision.},

Data on health system preparedness to manage hypertension and other non-communicable diseases remains scarce. This study aimed to assess the preparedness of lower-level health facilities for outpatient primary care of hypertension in Tanzania. Methods This study used data from the 2014-2015 Tanzania Service Provision Assessment survey. The facility was considered as prepared for the outpatient primary care of hypertension if reported at least half (¿= 50\%) of the items listed from each of the three domains (staff training and guideline, basic diagnostic equipment, and basic medicines) as identified by World Health Organization-Service Availability and Readiness Assessment manual. Data were analyzed using Stata 14. An unadjusted logistic regression model was used to assess the association between outcome and explanatory variables. All variables with a P value ¡ 0.2 were fitted into the multiple logistic regression models using a 5\% significance level. Results Out of 725 health facilities involved in the current study, about 68\% were public facilities and 73\% located in rural settings. Only 28\% of the assessed facilities were considered prepared for the outpatient primary care of hypertension. About 9\% and 42\% of the assessed facilities reported to have at least one trained staff and guidelines for hypertension respectively. In multivariate analysis, private facilities [{AOR} = 2.7, 95\% {CI}; 1.2-6.1], urban location [{AOR} = 2.2, 95\% {CI}; 1.2-4.2], health centers [{AOR} = 5.2, 95\% {CI}; 3.1-8.7] and the performance of routine management meetings [{AOR} = 2.6, 95\% {CI}; 1.1-5.9] were significantly associated with preparedness for the outpatient primary care of hypertension. Conclusion The primary healthcare system in Tanzania is not adequately equipped to cope with the increasing burden of hypertension and other non-communicable diseases. Rural location, public ownership, and absence of routine management meetings were associated with being not prepared. There is a need to strengthen the primary healthcare system in Tanzania for better management of chronic diseases and curb their rising impact on health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background
Utilization of antenatal care ({ANC}) services has increased over the past two decades. Continued gains in maternal and newborn health will require an understanding of both access and quality of {ANC} services. We linked health facility and household survey data to examine the quality of service provision for five {ANC} interventions across health facilities in sub–Saharan Africa.

Methods
Using data from 20 nationally representative health facility assessments – the Service Provision Assessment ({SPA}) and the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}), we estimated facility level readiness to deliver five {ANC} interventions: tetanus toxoid vaccine for pregnant women, intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in pregnancy ({IPTp}), syphilis detection and treatment in pregnancy, iron supplementation and hypertensive disease case management. Facility level indicators were stratified by health facility type, managing authority and location, then linked to estimates of {ANC} utilization in that stratum from the corresponding Demographic and Health Surveys ({DHS}) to generate population level estimates of the ‘likelihood of appropriate care’. Finally, the association between estimates of the ‘likelihood of appropriate care’ from the linking approach and estimates of coverage levels from the {DHS} were assessed.

Findings
A total of 10 534 health facilities were surveyed in the 20 health facility assessments, of which 8742 reported offering {ANC} services and were included in the analysis. Health facility readiness to deliver {IPTp}, iron supplementation, and tetanus toxoid vaccination was higher (median: 84.1\%, 84.9\% and 82.8\% respectively) than readiness to deliver hypertensive disease case management and syphilis detection and treatment (median: 23.0\% and 19.9\% respectively). Coverage of at least 4 {ANC} visits ranged from 24.8\% to 75.8\%. Estimates of the likelihood of appropriate care derived from linking health facility and household survey data showed marked gaps for all interventions, particularly hypertensive disease case management and syphilis detection and treatment. There was fairly good concordance between our estimates of high likelihood of appropriate care and {DHS} estimates of coverage for iron supplementation, {IPTp}, and tetanus toxoid vaccination.

Conclusion
Linking household surveys to health facility assessments revealed marked gaps in population–level coverage of quality {ANC} interventions and underscored the need for a double–pronged approach to increase {ANC} utilization and improve the quality of {ANC} services.},

	abstract = {Objectives To determine the extent of provider communication, predictors of good communication and the association between provider communication and patient outcomes, such as patient satisfaction, in seven sub-Saharan African countries.
Design Cross-sectional, multicountry study.
Setting Data from recent Service Provision Assessment ({SPA}) surveys from seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa. {SPA} surveys include assessment of facility inputs and processes as well as interviews with caretakers of sick children. These data included 3898 facilities and 4627 providers.
Participants 16 352 caregivers visiting the facility for their sick children.
Primary and secondary outcome measures We developed an index of four recommended provider communication items for a sick child assessment based on {WHO} guidelines. We assessed potential predictors of provider communication and considered whether better provider communication was associated with intent to return to the facility for care.
Results The average score of the composite indicator of provider communication was low, at 35\% ({SD} 26.9). Fifty-four per cent of caregivers reported that they were told the child’s diagnosis, and only 10\% reported that they were counselled on feeding for the child. Caregivers’ educational attainment and provider preservice education and training in integrated management of childhood illness were associated with better communication. Private facilities and facilities with better infrastructure received higher communication scores. Caretakers reporting better communication were significantly more likely to state intent to return to the facility (relative risk: 1.19, 95\% {CI} 1.16 to 1.22).
Conclusions There are major deficiencies in communication during sick child visits. These are associated with lower provider education as well as less well-equipped facilities. Poor communication, in turn, is linked to lower satisfaction and intention to return to facility among caregivers of sick children. Countries should test strategies for enhancing quality of communication in their efforts to improve health outcomes and patient experience.},

	abstract = {Background: High quality of care in family planning ({FP}) services has been found to be associated with increased and continued use of contraceptive methods. The interpersonal skills and technical competence of the provider is one of the main components of quality of care. To study the process component of quality of care, the distribution of the {FP} counseling topics was examined by client, provider and facility characteristics. To assess the outcomes of quality of care, client satisfaction and their knowledge of their method's protection from {STIs} were used. This study examined the factors associated with these outcomes with a focus on provider counseling and training. Methods: Data from the 2012-2013 Senegal Service Provision Assessment survey was used for the analysis. The survey included a representative sample of the health facilities in Senegal and collects data by observing the clients' {FP} visits and conducting exit interviews. The main outcomes of interest were provider's counseling in {FP}, client's satisfaction with {FP} services and client's knowledge of their method's protection from {STIs}. Several covariates were used in the analysis which represent client, provider and facility characteristics. Results: The level of counseling was inadequate-very low proportions of providers that performed different types of counseling. Counseling was more likely to be provided to new than returning clients. Approximately 84\% of the clients were very satisfied with services but only 58\% had correct knowledge of their method's protection from {STIs}. Clients were significantly less likely to be very satisfied when their providers counseled on side effects and when to return, and counseling provided on method's protection from {STIs} did not significantly improve knowledge in this area. Clients seen by a provider with {FP} training had almost twice the odds of having correct knowledge about their method's protection from {STIs} compared with clients seen by a provider with no recent training. Conclusions: The percentage of providers offering {FP} counseling to their clients was relatively low and was ineffective on the client-focused outcomes. Interventions may be required for more effective counseling methods that are client-centered as well as providing more {FP} training to providers.},

              Objective
              
                Traditionally, health systems in sub‐Saharan Africa have focused on acute conditions. Few data exist on the readiness of African health facilities (
                {HF}
                s) to address the growing burden of chronic diseases (
                {CD}

              Background
              As low- and middle-income countries experience economic development, ensuring quality of health care delivery is a central component of health reform. Nevertheless, health reforms in low- and middle-income countries have focused more on access to services rather than the quality of these services, and reporting on quality has been limited. In the present study, we sought to examine the prevalence and regional variation in key management practices in Egyptian health facilities within three domains: supervision of the facility from the Ministry of Health and Population ({MOHP}), managerial processes, and patient and community involvement in care.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from 559 facilities surveyed with the Egyptian Service Provision Assessment ({ESPA}) survey in 2004, the most recent such survey in Egypt. We registered on the Measure Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}) website
                http://legacy.measuredhs.com/login.cfm
                to gain access to the survey data. From the {ESPA} sampled 559 {MOHP} facilities, we excluded a total of 79 facilities because they did not offer facility-based 24-hour care or have at least one physician working in the facility, resulting in a final sample of 480 facilities. The final sample included 76 general service hospitals, 307 rural health units, and 97 maternal and child health and urban health units ({MCH}/urban units). We used standard frequency analyses to describe facility characteristics and tested the statistical significance of regional differences using chi-square statistics.
              
            
            
              Results
              Nearly all facilities reported having external supervision within the 6 months preceding the interview. In contrast, key facility-level managerial processes, such as having routine and documented management meetings and applying quality assurance approaches, were uncommon. Involvement of communities and patients was also reported in a minority of facilities. Hospitals and health units located in Urban Egypt compared with more rural parts of Egypt were significantly more likely to have management committees that met at least monthly, to keep official records of the meetings, and to have an approach for reviewing quality assurance activities.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Although the data precede the recent reform efforts of the {MOHP}, they provide a baseline against which future progress can be measured. Targeted efforts to improve facility-level management are critical to supporting quality improvement initiatives directed at improving the quality of health care throughout the country.},

The Kenya Service Provision Assessment is a representative sample of health facilities in the public and private sectors, and comprises data obtained from a facility inventory, service provider interviews, observations of client–provider interactions and exit interviews. Quality-of-care indicators are compared between the public and private sectors along three dimensions: structure, process and outcome.Private facilities were superior to public sector facilities in terms of physical infrastructure and the availability of services. Public sector facilities were more likely to have management systems in place. There was no difference between public and private providers in the technical quality of care provided. Private providers were better at managing interpersonal aspects of care. The higher level of client satisfaction at private facilities could not be explained by differences between public and private facilities in structural and process aspects of care.Formal private sector facilities providing family planning services exhibit greater readiness to provide services and greater attention to client needs than public sector facilities in Kenya. Consistent with this, client satisfaction is much higher at private facilities. Technical quality of care provided is similar in public and private facilities.},

	abstract = {Background: There is a four-fold risk for hepatitis B infection among healthcare workers compared to the general population. Due to limited access to diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B in many resource-constrained settings, there is a real risk that only few healthcare workers with viral hepatitis may get screened or diagnosed and treated. Studies on hepatitis B vaccination among healthcare workers in developing countries are sparse and this bodes ill for intervention and support. The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence and explored the associated factors that predicted the uptake of the required, full dosage of hepatitis B vaccination among healthcare workers ({HCWs}) in five developing countries using nationally representative data. Methods: We used recent datasets from the Demographic and Health Surveys Program’s Service Provision Assessment Survey. Descriptive summary statistics and logistic regressions were used to produce the results. Statistical significance was pegged at p {\textless} 0.05. Results: The proportion of {HCWs} who received the required doses of hepatitis B vaccine in Afghanistan, Haiti, Malawi, Nepal, and Senegal were 69.1\%, 11.3\%, 15.4\%, 46.5\%, and 17.6\%, respectively. Gender, occupational qualification, and years of education were significant correlates of receiving the required doses of hepatitis B among {HCWs}. Conclusions: Given the increased risk of hepatitis B infection among healthcare workers, policymakers in developing countries should intensify education campaigns among {HCWs} and, perhaps, must take it a step further by making hepatitis B vaccination compulsory and a key requirement for employment, especially among those workers who regularly encounter bodily fluids of patients. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Aim: The contribution of the private for-profit sector healthcare provider, along with public and {NGOs} in Bangladesh’s healthcare system is paramount to health gains. All three play a vital role in the quality of health care, service provision, and accessibility for vulnerable populations. This study investigates the strengths and weaknesses of different health facility types regarding service readiness in Bangladesh according to geography, management type, and divisions. Subject and Methods: Using data from the Bangladesh Health Facility Survey 2017, composite readiness scores were calculated across various healthcare facilities by management type along with multivariate regression analysis to assess the relationship between covariates and the dependent variable. Findings: The average general service readiness score of health facilities in Bangladesh was 47.3\% (ranging from diagnostic capacity = 19.5\% to basic equipment = 75.9\%). General service readiness for private hospitals are higher than union, upazila, and district level public facilities. Health facilities located in rural areas had significantly lower general readiness scores than urban areas. Facilities integrating feedback mechanisms and quality assurance activities had higher general service readiness scores of 2.6\% and 2.1\%, respectively. Conclusion: Key gaps in diagnostic capacity and essential medicine readiness were identified, while consistent readiness is noted around basic amenities, equipment, and standard precautions. Higher readiness in private and urban facilities were also noted. These findings uncovered priority areas to support design efforts around achieving universal health coverage in neglected regions and can be utilized for policy development and financial investment efforts for healthcare provision at the primary level, particularly for rural and public facilities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag {GmbH} Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Objective To assess the readiness of public and private health facilities ({HFs}) in delivering services related to non-communicable diseases ({NCDs}) in Nepal. Methods We analysed data from nationally representative Nepal Health Facility Survey 2021 to determine the readiness of {HFs} for cardiovascular diseases ({CVDs}), diabetes mellitus ({DM}), chronic respiratory diseases ({CRDs}) and mental health ({MH})-related services using Service Availability and Readiness Assessment Manual of the {WHO}. Readiness score was measured as the average availability of tracer items in per cent, and {HFs} were considered ready' for {NCDs} management if they scored ≥70 (out of 100). We performed weighted univariate and multivariable logistic regression to determine the association of {HFs} readiness with province, type of {HFs}, ecological region, quality assurance activities, external supervision, client's opinion review and frequency of meetings in {HFs}. Results The overall mean readiness score of {HFs} offering {CRDs}, {CVDs}, {DM} and {MH}-related services was 32.6, 38.0, 38.4 and 24.0, respectively. Guidelines and staff training domain had the lowest readiness score, whereas essential equipment and supplies domain had the highest readiness score for each of the {NCD}-related services. A total of 2.3\%, 3.8\%, 3.6\% and 3.3\% {HFs} were ready to deliver {CRDs}, {CVDs}, {DM} and {MH}-related services, respectively. {HFs} managed by local level were less likely to be ready to provide all {NCD}-related services compared with federal/provincial hospitals. {HFs} with external supervision were more likely to be ready to provide {CRDs} and {DM}-related services and {HFs} reviewing client's opinions were more likely to be ready to provide {CRDs}, {CVDs} and {DM}-related services. Conclusion Readiness of the {HFs} managed by local level to provide {CVDs}, {DM}, {CRDs} and {MH}-related services was relatively poor compared with federal/provincial hospitals. Prioritisation of policies to reduce the gaps in readiness and capacity strengthening of the local {HFs} is essential for improving their overall readiness to provide {NCD}-related services.  © 2023 {BMJ} Publishing Group.

	abstract = {Introduction Hypertension is a growing burden in Uganda and other low and middle-income countries. Appropriate diagnosis services are needed at primary care health facilities to identify, initiate treatment for, and manage hypertension. This study assessed service availability and readiness as well as facilitators and barriers in primary health care facilities for hypertension diagnosis services in Wakiso District, Uganda Methods In July and August 2019, we conducted structured interviews at 77 randomly selected primary care health facilities in Wakiso District. We used an interviewer-administered health facility checklist modified from the World Health Organization’s service availability and readiness assessment tool. We also conducted 13 key informant interviews with health workers and district-level managers. Readiness was measured by availability of functional diagnostic equipment, related supplies and tools, and health provider attributes. Service availability was measured by assessing hypertension diagnosis services. Results Most (86\%; 66 of 77) health facilities offered hypertension diagnosis services and 84\% (65 of 77) had digital blood pressure measuring devices; only 69\% (53 of 77) had functional blood pressure measuring devices. Lower-level facilities lacked appropriate blood pressure cuffs for use across age groups: 92\% (71 of 77) lacked pediatric cuffs and 52\% (40 of 77) lacked alternative adult cuffs. Facilitators for diagnosing hypertension included partners that built health facility staff capacity and funds for purchasing hypertension diagnostic supplies; common barriers were nonfunctional equipment, delays in receiving training, and inadequate staffing. Conclusion The results highlight the need for an adequate supply of devices, routine replacements or repairs, and frequent refresher training for health workers. © 2023, Preventing Chronic Disease.

	abstract = {Background Service availability and readiness are critical for the delivery of quality and essential health care services. In Ghana, there is paucity of literature that describes general service readiness ({GSR}) of primary health care ({PHC}) facilities within the national context. This study therefore assessed the {GSR} of {PHC} facilities in Ghana to provide evidence to inform heath policy and drive action towards reducing health inequities. Methods We analysed data from 140 Service Delivery Points ({SDPs}) that were part of the Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 survey ({PMA}2020). {GSR} was computed using the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) manual based on four out of five components. Descriptive statistics were computed for both continuous and categorical variables. A multivariable binary logistic regression model was fitted to assess predictors of scoring above the mean {GSR}. Analyses were performed using Stata version 16.0. Significance level was set at p¡0.05. Results The average {GSR} index of {SDPs} in this study was 83.4\%. Specifically, the mean {GSR} of hospitals was 92.8\%, whereas health centres/clinics and {CHPS} compounds scored 78.0\% and 64.3\% respectively. The least average scores were observed in the essential medicines and standard precautions for infection prevention categories. We found significant sub-national, urban-rural and facility-related disparities in {GSR}. Compared to the Greater Accra Region, {SDPs} in the Eastern, Western, Upper East and Upper West Regions had significantly reduced odds of scoring above the overall {GSR}. Majority of {SDPs} with {GSR} below the average were from rural areas. Conclusion Overall, {GSR} among {SDPs} is appreciable as compared to other settings. The study high-lights the existence of regional, urban-rural and facility-related differences in {GSR} of {SDPs}. The reality of health inequities has crucial policy implications which need to be addressed urgently to fast-track progress towards the achievement of the {SDGs} and {UHC} targets by 2030.},

	abstract = {Background: In low-income nations such as Ethiopia, noncommunicable diseases ({NCDs}) are becoming more common. The Ethiopian Ministry of Health has prioritized {NCD} prevention, early diagnosis, and management. However, research on the readiness of public health facilities to address {NCDs}, particularly hypertension and type {II} diabetes mellitus, is limited. Methods: The study used a multistage cluster sampling method and a health facility-based cross-sectional study design. A total of 83 health facilities were evaluated based on {WHO}’s Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) tool to investigate the availability of services and the readiness of the primary health care unit ({PHCU}) to manage type {II} diabetes and Hypertension. Trained data collectors interviewed with {PHCU} head or {NCD} focal persons. The study tried to investigate (1) the availability of basic amenities and the four domains: staff and guidelines, basic equipment, diagnostic materials, and essential medicines used to manage {DM} and {HPN}, (2) the readiness of the {PHCU} to manage {DM} and {HPN}. The data were processed by using {SPSS} version 24. Descriptive statistics, including frequency and percentage, inferential statistics like the chi-square test, and logistic regression models were used to analyze the data. Results: Of the 82 health facilities, only 29\% and 28\% of the {PHCU} identified as ready to manage {HPN} and {DM}. Facility type, facility location, presence of guidelines, trained staff, groups of antihypertensive and antidiabetic medicines had a significant impact (P {\textless} 0.05) on the readiness of the {PHCU} to manage {HPN} and {DM} at a 0.05 level of significance. Facilities located in urban were 8.2 times more likely to be ready to manage {HPN} cases than facilities located in rural ({AOR} = 8.2, 95\% {CI} [2.4–28.5]) and P {\textless} 0.05. Conclusion and recommendation: The results identified comparatively poor and deprived readiness to offer {HPN} and {DM} services at lower-level health facilities (health centers). Equipping the lower-level health facilities with screening and diagnostic materials, essential medicines, and provision of basic training for the health care providers and {NCD} guidelines should be available, especially in the lower health care facilities.

	abstract = {Background Caesarean section has a significant role in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality. A linked analysis of population and health facility data is valuable to map and identify caesarean section use and associated factors. This study aimed to identify geographic variation and associated factors of caesarean delivery in Ethiopia. Method Linked data analysis of the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey ({EDHS}) and the 2014 Ethiopian Service Provision Assessment Plus ({ESPA}+) survey was performed. Spatial analysis was conducted to identify geographic variations and factors associated with caesarean delivery. Hierarchical Bayesian analysis was also performed to identify factors associated with caesarean delivery using the {SAS} {MCMC} procedure. Results Women's age and education, household wealth, parity, antenatal care ({ANC}) visits, and distance to caesarean section facility were associated with caesarean delivery use. Women who had ¿= 4 {ANC} visits were 4.67 (95\% Credible Interval ({CrI}): 2.17, 9.43) times more likely to have caesarean delivery compared to those who had no {ANC} visits. Women who had education and were from rich households were also 2.80 (95\% {CrI}: 1.83, 4.19) and 1.80 (95\% {CrI}: 1.08, 2.84) times more likely to have caesarean deliveries relative to women who had no education and were from poor households, respectively. A one-kilometer increase in distance to a caesarean section facility was associated with an 88\% reduction in the odds of caesarean delivery (Adjusted Odds Ratio ({AOR}) = 0.12, 95\% {CrI}: 0.01, 0.78). Hotspots of high caesarean section rates were observed in Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, and the Harari region. In addition, women's age at first childbirth and ¿= 4 {ANC} visits showed significant spatially varying relations between caesarean delivery use across Ethiopia. Conclusion Caesarean section is a lifesaving procedure, and it is essential to narrow disparities to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality and avoid unnecessary procedures.},

The objectives of this short communication were 1) to assess the availability of {WASH} services and standard precautions in {HCFs} in seven provinces in Afghanistan before the {COVID}-19 pandemic, and 2) to elucidate the relevance of these patterns with the number of reported {HCW} infections from {COVID}-19 in the mentioned provinces. Methods: We analyzed secondary data from the 2018-19 Afghanistan Service Provision Assessment survey, which included 142 public and private {HCFs} in seven major provinces in Afghanistan. Data on {COVID}-19 cases were obtained from the Afghanistan Ministry of Public Health Data Warehouse. Weighted prevalence of {WASH} services and standard precautions were calculated using frequencies and percentages. {ArcGIS} maps were used to visualize the distribution of {COVID}-19 cases, and scatter plots were created to visualize the relevance of {WASH} services and standard precautions to {COVID}-19 cases in provinces. Results: Of the 142 facilities surveyed, about 97\% had improved water sources, and over 94\% had improved toilet for clients. Overall, {HCFs} had limited availability of hygiene services and standard precautions, which was lower in private than public facilities. More than half of the facilities had safe final disposal and appropriate storage of sharps and medical waste. Of the seven provinces, Herat province had the highest cumulative {COVID}-19 case rate among {HCWs} per 100,000 population and reported lower availability of {WASH} services and standard precautions in {HCFs} compared to other provinces. Conclusion: Our findings show disparities in the availability of {WASH} services and standard precautions in public and private facilities. Private facilities had a lower availability of hygiene services and standard precautions than public facilities. Provinces with higher availability of {WASH} services and standard precautions in {HCFs} had a lower cumulative {COVID}-19 case rate among {HCWs} per 100,000 population. Pre-pandemic preparation of adequate {WASH} services and standard precautions in {HCFs} could be potentially important in combating infectious disease emergence. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Overall, resilient health systems build upon sufficient, qualified, well-distributed, and motivated health workers; however, this precious resource is limited in numbers to meet people’s demands, particularly in {LMICs}. Understanding the subnational distribution of health workers from different lens is critical to ensure quality healthcare and improving health outcomes. Methods: Using data from Health Personnel Information System, facility-level Service Availability and Readiness Assessment, and other sources, we performed a district-level longitudinal analysis to assess health workforce density and the ratio of male to female health workers between January 2016 and June 2020 across all districts in Mozambique. Results: 22 011 health workers were sampled, of whom 10 405 (47.3\%) were male. The average age was 35 years ({SD}: 9.4). Physicians (1025, 4.7\%), maternal and child health nurses (4808, 21.8\%), and nurses (6402, 29.1\%) represented about 55\% of the sample. In January 2016, the average district-level workforce density was 75.8 per 100 000 population (95\% {CI} 65.9, 87.1), and was increasing at an annual rate of 8.0\% (95\% {CI} 6.00, 9.00) through January 2018. The annual growth rate declined to 3.0\% (95\% {CI} 2.00, 4.00) after January 2018. Two provinces, Maputo City and Maputo Province, with 268.3 (95\% {CI} 186.10, 387.00) and 104.6 (95\% {CI} 84.20, 130.00) health workers per 100 000 population, respectively, had the highest workforce density at baseline (2016). There were 3122 community health workers ({CHW}), of whom 72.8\% were male, in January 2016. The average number of {CHWs} per 10 000 population was 1.33 (95\% {CI} 1.11, 1.59) in 2016 and increased by 18\% annually between January 2016 and January 2018. This trend reduced to 11\% (95\% {CI} 0.00, 13.00) after January 2018. The sex ratio was twice as high for all provinces in the central and northern regions relative to Maputo Province. Maputo City ({OR}: 0.34; 95\% {CI} 0.32, 0.34) and Maputo Province ({OR}: 0.56; 95\% {CI} 0.49, 0.65) reported the lowest sex ratio at the baseline. Encouragingly, important sex ratio improvements were observed after January 2018, particularly in the northern and central regions. Conclusion: Mozambique made substantial progress in health workers’ availability during the study period; however, with a critical slowdown after 2018. Despite the progress, meaningful shortages and distribution disparities persist. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To assess existing knowledge related to methodological considerations for linking population-based surveys and health facility data to generate effective coverage estimates. Effective coverage estimates the proportion of individuals in need of an intervention who receive it with sufficient quality to achieve health benefit.
{DESIGN}: Systematic review of available literature.
{DATA} {SOURCES}: Medline, Carolina Population Health Center and Demographic and Health Survey publications and handsearch of related or referenced works of all articles included in full text review. The search included publications from 1 January 2000 to 29 March 2021.
{ELIGIBILITY} {CRITERIA}: Publications explicitly evaluating (1) the suitability of data, (2) the implications of the design of existing data sources and (3) the impact of choice of method for combining datasets to obtain linked coverage estimates.
{RESULTS}: Of 3805 papers reviewed, 70 publications addressed relevant issues. Limited data suggest household surveys can be used to identify sources of care, but their validity in estimating intervention need was variable. Methods for collecting provider data and constructing quality indices were diverse and presented limitations. There was little empirical data supporting an association between structural, process and outcome quality. Few studies addressed the influence of the design of common data sources on linking analyses, including imprecise household geographical information system data, provider sampling design and estimate stability. The most consistent evidence suggested under certain conditions, combining data based on geographical proximity or administrative catchment (ecological linking) produced similar estimates to linking based on the specific provider utilised (exact match linking).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Linking household and healthcare provider data can leverage existing data sources to generate more informative estimates of intervention coverage and care. However, existing evidence on methods for linking data for effective coverage estimation are variable and numerous methodological questions remain. There is need for additional research to develop evidence-based, standardised best practices for these analyses.},

	abstract = {In many low- and middle-income countries, geographical accessibility continues to be a barrier to health care utilization. In this paper, we aim to better understand the full relationship between distance to providers and utilization of maternal delivery services. We address three methodological challenges: non-linear effects between distance and utilization; unobserved heterogeneity through non-random distance “assignment”; and heterogeneous effects of distance. Linking Malawi Demographic Health Survey household data to Service Provision Assessment facility data, we consider distance as a continuous treatment variable, estimating a Dose-Response Function based on generalized propensity scores, allowing exploration of non-linearities in the effect of an increment in distance at different distance exposures. Using an instrumental variables approach, we examine the potential for unobserved differences between women residing at different distances to health facilities. Our results suggest distance significantly reduces the probability of having a facility delivery, with evidence of non-linearities in the effect. The negative relationship is shown to be particularly strong for women with poor health knowledge and lower socio-economic status, with important implications for equity. We also find evidence of potential unobserved confounding, suggesting that methods that ignore such confounding may underestimate the effect of distance on the utilization of health services.},

	abstract = {Background: Health outcomes in Haiti can be characterized as one of the poorest in the Caribbean region. As a result, the country has one of the shortest life expectancies in the region, which is estimated to be 63 years. Haiti's poor health outcome is partly attributed to lower technical efficiency ({TE}) of health production. The objective of this study was to estimate the {TE} of health production in all health facilities in the country. Methods: We used the 2013 Haiti's Service Provision Assessment ({SPA}) survey data and employed the Stochastic Frontier Analysis ({SFA}) framework. We specified a health production model with outpatient visits as output and number of health workers and general service readiness index ({GSRI}) as input indicators. In addition, type of facility, location and management indicators were used as covariates to control for facility heterogeneity. The model was specified with both Cobb-Douglas ({CD}) and Translog ({TL}) functional forms. We also considered the half-normal ({HN}), exponential, and truncated distributions for the {TE} term. Results: Number of health workers and the level of service readiness of health facilities have positive and significant association with outpatient visits. Keeping other factors constant, if the number of health workers per health facility increases by 1\%, then outpatient visits may increase by 0.65\% per month. Similarly, if health service readiness index increases by 1\%, outpatient visits can be increased by up to 2.1\%. The {TE} of health facilities is estimated at 51\%, which shows the availability of significant room for efficiency gains. Conclusions: Number of health workers and general service readiness determine facility-based health production. Outpatient visit can be increased by 0.65\% and 2.1\% respectively if number of health workers and {GSRI} each increase by 1\%. However, there is also a significant waste under the current health production system. Health facilities can serve more outpatient visits which can reach up to 49\% from the current figures with the available resource if they implement best practices. © Journal of Hospital Management and Health Policy.

	abstract = {Objective: High-quality healthcare is essential to ensuring maternal and newborn survival. Efficient measurement requires knowing how long measures of quality provide consistent insight for intended uses. Methods: We used a repeated health facility assessment in Senegal to calculate structural and process quality of antenatal care ({ANC}), delivery and child health services in facilities assessed 2 years apart. We tested agreement of quality measures within facilities and regions. We estimated how much input-adjusted and process quality-adjusted coverage measures changed for each service when calculated using quality measurements from the same facilities measured 2 years apart. Results: Over 6 waves of continuous surveys, 628 paired assessments were completed. Changes at the facility level were substantial and often positive, but inconsistent. Structural quality measures were moderately correlated (0.40–0.69) within facilities over time, more so in hospitals; correlation was {\textless}0.20 for process measures based on direct observation of {ANC} and child visits. Most measures were more strongly correlated once averaged to regions; process quality of child services was not (−0.32). Median relative difference in national-adjusted coverage estimates was 6.0\%; differences in subnational estimates were largest for process quality of child services (19.6\%). Conclusion: Continuous measures of structural quality demonstrated consistency at regional levels and in higher level facilities over 2 years; results for process measures were mixed. Direct observation of child visits provided inconsistent measures over time. For other measures, linking population data with health facility assessments from up to 2 years prior is likely to introduce modest measurement error in adjusted coverage estimates. © 2021 The Authors Tropical Medicine \& International Health Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

As part of a collaborative health system strengthening project, we assessed and compared the preparedness and operational capacity of two target networks of public {PHC} settings in Lilongwe (Malawi) and Lusaka (Zambia) to integrate {NCD} services within routine service delivery. Data was collected and analyzed using validated health facility survey tools. These baseline assessments conducted between August 2018 and March 2019, also included interviews with 20 on-site health personnel and focal persons, who described existing barriers in delivering {NCD} services. In both countries, policy directives to decentralize disease-specific {NCD} services to the primary care level were initiated to meet increased demand but lacked operational guidance. In general, the assessed {PHC} sites were inadequately prepared to integrate {NCDs} into various service delivery domains, thus requiring further support. In spite of existing multi-faceted limitations, there was motivation among healthcare staff to provide {NCD} services.},

When assessing access to health services, traditional urban-rural dichotomies may mask substantial variation. We use geospatial methods to link household data from the 2015-2016 Malawi Demographic Health Survey to health facility data from the Malawi Service Provision Assessment and apply a new proposed four-category classification of geographic area (urban major metropolitan area, urban township, rural, and remote) to evaluate households' distance to, and choice of, primary, secondary, and tertiary health care in Malawi. Applying this new four-category definition, approximately 3.8 million rural- and urban-defined individuals would be reclassified into new groups, nearly a quarter of Malawi's 2015 population. There were substantial differences in distance to the nearest facility using this new categorization: remote households are (on average) an additional 5 km away from secondary and tertiary care services versus rural households. Health service choice differs also, particularly in urban areas, a distinction that is lost when using a simple binary classification: those living in major metropolitan households have a choice of five facilities offering comprehensive primary care services within a 10-km zone, whereas urban township households have no choice, with only one such facility within 10 km. Future research should explore how such expanded classifications can be standardized and used to strengthen public health and demographic research.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The maternal health field has recently focused on the importance of interpersonal quality of care and continues to cite structural deficits as a contributor to poor interpersonal treatment. This hypothesis is supported by qualitative evidence. This study quantitatively tested the effect of maternal health structural inputs on interpersonal quality of care during childbirth. Methods: Analyses were conducted using data from the 2013 to 2014 Malawi Service Provision Assessment, which documented the availability and quality of health facility services and included the observation of laboring and delivering women. Maternal health structural inputs were measured using 26 facility infrastructure variables. The outcome, interpersonal quality of care, was measured as a sum score of 12 items collected during the observations. Crude and adjusted associations between maternal health structural inputs on interpersonal quality of care were assessed using linear regression with cluster robust standard errors. Results: 345 Observations of delivering women in 174 health facilities were included in the analysis. 19.1\% of women delivered in a facility with high maternal health structural inputs, and the mean interpersonal quality of care score was 8.9/12. Maternal health structural inputs had a small, non-meaningful association with interpersonal quality of care during childbirth (adjusted β − 0.19, 95\% {CI} − 0.85, 0.47). Conclusions for Practice: These findings do not verify the quality of care frameworks or qualitative evidence that support the relationship between structure and interpersonal quality of care. While structural inputs are important for health system performance, the results suggest that they might not be necessary for a respectful childbirth experience. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, {LLC}, part of Springer Nature.},

Design Cross-sectional analysis of population-based and health facility data.
Setting Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey data linked to Service Provision Assessment data.
Population 8473 married women and 1020 facilities that reported providing family planning services.
Methods A linked secondary data analysis of population and health facility data was carried out. Both multilevel and spatial analyses were conducted to identify key determinants of women’s use of modern contraceptive and spatial clustering of modern contraceptive use.
Main outcome measure Modern contraceptive use.
Results About 24\% of the variation in the use of modern contraception was accounted for by location. A one-unit increase in the mean score of health facilities’ readiness to provide short-term modern contraceptives in a typical region was associated with a 20-fold increase in the odds of modern contraceptive use (adjusted {OR} ({AOR}) 20.49, 95\% {CI} 1.44 to 29.54). In the spatial analysis, it was found that Addis Ababa and the Amhara region had high clusters of modern contraceptive use rates. On the other hand, low rates of contraceptive use were clustered in the Afar and Somali regions.
Conclusion There were significant variations in the use of modern contraceptives across the different regions of Ethiopia. Therefore, regions with low contraceptive rates and high fertility rates should be targeted for scaling up and tailoring of services to the culture and lifestyles of the population of those regions.},

Methods Using Global Positioning System ({GPS}) data for {DHS} clusters and for health facilities, we linked each {DHS} cluster to all of the family planning facilities located within a specified distance, and then measured the cluster's level of contraceptive method choice based on the number of facilities within the buffer zone that offered three or more modern contraceptive methods. Random intercept logistic regressions were used to model the variation in individual modern contraceptive use and the availability of multiple method choices at the cluster level. Results Limited number of family planning facilities in Haiti offered at least three modern contraceptive methods (51\% in urban and 23\% in rural). Seventeen percent of both rural and urban women lived in an area with low availability of multiple methods-meaning that no facility in the specified buffer zone offered three or more contraceptive methods. Another 29\% of rural women and 41\% of urban women had medium availability-that is, only one facility in the buffer zone offered three or more methods. In rural areas, compared with women living in a cluster with low availability of multiple methods, the odds of using a modern method are 73\% higher for women living in a cluster with medium availability, and over twice as high for women living in a cluster with high availability. A similar positive relationship was also found in urban areas. Conclusions Women in Haiti have only limited proximity to a health facility offering a variety of contraceptive methods. Improving access to a range of methods available at health facilities near where people live is critical for increasing contraceptive use in both urban and rural areas of Haiti.},

	abstract = {Objective: Although substantial progress has been made in increasing access to care during childbirth, reductions in maternal and neonatal mortality have been slower. Poor-quality care may be to blame. In this study, we measure the quality of labour and delivery services in Kenya and Malawi using data from observations of deliveries and explore factors associated with levels of competent and respectful care. Methods: We used data from nationally representative health facility assessment surveys. A total of 1100 deliveries in 392 facilities across Kenya and Malawi were observed and quality was assessed using two indices: the quality of the process of intrapartum and immediate postpartum care ({QoPIIPC}) index and a previously validated index of respectful maternity care. Data from standardised observations of care were analysed using descriptive statistics and multivariable random-intercept regression models to examine factors associated with variation in quality of care. We also quantified the variance in quality explained by each domain of covariates (patient-, provider- and facility-level and subnational divisions). Results: Only 61–66\% of basic elements of competent and respectful care were performed. In adjusted models, better-staffed facilities, private hospitals and morning deliveries were associated with higher levels of competent and respectful care. In Malawi, younger, primipara and {HIV}-positive women received higher-quality care. Quality also differed substantially across regions in Kenya, with a 25 percentage-point gap between Nairobi and the Coast region. Quality was also higher in higher-volume facilities and those with caesarean section capacity. Most of the explained variance in quality was due to regions in Kenya and to facility, and patient-level characteristics in Malawi. Conclusions: Our findings suggest considerable scope for improvement in quality. Increasing staffing and shifting births to higher-volume facilities – along with promotion of respectful care in these facilities – should be considered in sub-Saharan Africa to improve outcomes for mothers and newborns. © 2019 The Authors Tropical Medicine \& International Health Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Postabortion care ({PAC}) is an essential component of emergency obstetric care ({EmOC}) and is necessary to prevent unsafe abortion-related maternal mortality, but we know little regarding the preparedness of facilities to provide {PAC} services, the distribution of these services and disparities in their accessibility in low-resource settings. To address this knowledge gap, this study aims to describe {PAC} service availability, evaluate {PAC} readiness and measure inequities in access to {PAC} services in seven states of Nigeria and nationally in Côte d'Ivoire. We used survey data from reproductive-age women and the health facilities that serve the areas where they live. We linked facility readiness information, including {PAC}-specific signal functions, to female data using geospatial information. Findings revealed less than half of facilities provide basic {PAC} services in Nigeria (48.4\%) but greater {PAC} availability in Côte d'Ivoire (70.5\%). Only 33.5\% and 36.9\% of facilities with the capacity to provide basic {PAC} and only 23.9\% and 37.5\% of facilities with the capacity to provide comprehensive {PAC} had all the corresponding signal functions in Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire, respectively. With regard to access, while ∼8 out of 10 women of reproductive age in Nigeria (81.3\%) and Côte d'Ivoire (79.9\%) lived within 10 km of a facility providing any {PAC} services, significantly lower levels of the population lived {\textless}10 km from a facility with all basic or comprehensive {PAC} signal functions, and we observed significant inequities in access for poor, rural and less educated women. Addressing facilities' service readiness will improve the quality of {PAC} provided and ensure postabortion complications can be treated in a timely and effective manner, while expanding the availability of services to additional primary-level facilities would increase access - both of which could help to reduce avoidable abortion-related maternal morbidity and mortality and associated inequities.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {Tanzanian youth have high levels of {HIV} risk and poor access to {HIV}-Testing. Oral self-implemented testing (Oral-{SIT}) provides an alternative that reduces barriers to {HIV}-Testing. We examined adaptations to Oral-{SIT} training components in a randomized experiment to evaluate a "train-The-Trainer"strategy for improving comprehension of graphic training materials. Participants (N = 257, age = 14-19 years) were randomly assigned to one of two self-Training conditions: graphic instruction book ({GIB}) or Video-{GIB}. Outcomes included behavioral performance fidelity, self-reported comprehension, and intentions to seek treatment. Video-{GIB} participants, relative to {GIB}-only participants, had higher performance fidelity scores, made fewer performance errors, had better instruction comprehension, and were more likely to intend to seek treatment. Oral-{SIT} timing errors were significantly more common among {GIB}-only participants. Graphic training materials in conjunction with a "train-The-Trainer"video has significant potential for increasing Oral-{SIT}'s reach by overcoming technological and literacy barriers.  © 2019 Society of Behavioral Medicine 2019.

	abstract = {Introduction Increases in facility deliveries in sub-Saharan Africa have not yielded expected declines in maternal mortality, raising concerns about the quality of care provided in facilities. The readiness of facilities at different health system levels to provide both emergency obstetric and newborn care ({EmONC}) as well as referral is unknown. We describe this combined readiness by facility level and region in Senegal.
Methods For this cross-sectional study, we used data from nine Demographic and Health Surveys between 1992 and 2017 in Senegal to describe trends in location of births over time. We used data from the 2017 Service Provision Assessment to describe {EmONC} and emergency referral readiness across facility levels in the public system, where 94\% of facility births occur. A national global positioning system facility census was used to map access from lower-level facilities to the nearest facility performing caesareans.
Results Births in facilities increased from 47\% in 1992 to 80\% in 2016, driven by births in lower-level health posts, where half of facility births now occur. Caesarean rates in rural areas more than doubled but only to 3.7\%, indicating minor improvements in {EmONC} access. Only 9\% of health posts had full readiness for basic {EmONC}, and 62\% had adequate referral readiness (vehicle on-site or telephone and vehicle access elsewhere). Although public facilities accounted for three-quarters of all births in 2016, only 16\% of such births occurred in facilities able to provide adequate combined readiness for {EmONC} and referral.
Conclusions Our findings imply that many lower-level public facilities—the most common place of birth in Senegal—are unable to treat or refer women with obstetric complications, especially in rural areas. In light of rising lower-level facility births in Senegal and elsewhere, improvements in {EmONC} and referral readiness are urgently needed to accelerate reductions in maternal and perinatal mortality.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study aimed at using survey data to predict skilled attendance at birth ({SBA}) across Ghana from healthcare quality and health facility accessibility. Methods: Through a cross-sectional, observational study, we used a random intercept mixed effects multilevel logistic modelling approach to estimate the odds of having {SBA} and then applied model estimates to spatial layers to assess the probability of {SBA} at high-spatial resolution across Ghana. We combined data from the Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}), routine birth registers, a service provision assessment of emergency obstetric care services, gridded population estimates and modelled travel time to health facilities. Results: Within an hour's travel, 97.1\% of women sampled in the {DHS} could access any health facility, 96.6\% could reach a facility providing birthing services, and 86.2\% could reach a secondary hospital. After controlling for characteristics of individual women, living in an urban area and close proximity to a health facility with high-quality services were significant positive determinants of {SBA} uptake. The estimated variance suggests significant effects of cluster and region on {SBA} as 7.1\% of the residual variation in the propensity to use {SBA} is attributed to unobserved regional characteristics and 16.5\% between clusters within regions. Conclusion: Given the expansion of primary care facilities in Ghana, this study suggests that higher quality healthcare services, as opposed to closer proximity of facilities to women, is needed to widen {SBA} uptake and improve maternal health. © 2020 The Authors Tropical Medicine \& International Health Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

	shorttitle = {Too poor or too far?},
	abstract = {Background: In sub-Saharan Africa, women are most likely to receive skilled and adequate childbirth care in hospital settings, yet the use of hospital for childbirth is low and inequitable. The poorest and those living furthest away from a hospital are most affected. But the relative contribution of poverty and travel time is convoluted, since hospitals are often located in wealthier urban places and are scarcer in poorer remote area. This study aims to partition the variability in hospital-based childbirth by poverty and travel time in four sub-Saharan African countries. Methods: We used data from the most recent Demographic and Health Survey in Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Tanzania. For each country, geographic coordinates of survey clusters, the master list of hospital locations and a high-resolution map of land surface friction were used to estimate travel time from each {DHS} cluster to the nearest hospital with a shortest-path algorithm. We quantified and compared the predicted probabilities of hospital-based childbirth resulting from one standard deviation ({SD}) change around the mean for different model predictors. Results: The mean travel time to the nearest hospital, in minutes, was 27 (Kenya), 31 (Malawi), 25 (Nigeria) and 62 (Tanzania). In Kenya, a change of 1SD in wealth led to a 33.2 percentage points change in the probability of hospital birth, whereas a 1SD change in travel time led to a change of 16.6 percentage points. The marginal effect of 1SD change in wealth was weaker than that of travel time in Malawi (13.1 vs. 34.0 percentage points) and Tanzania (20.4 vs. 33.7 percentage points). In Nigeria, the two were similar (22.3 vs. 24.8 percentage points) but their additive effect was twice stronger (44.6 percentage points) than the separate effects. Random effects from survey clusters also explained substantial variability in hospital-based childbirth in all countries, indicating other unobserved local factors at play. Conclusions: Both poverty and long travel time are important determinants of hospital birth, although they vary in the extent to which they influence whether women give birth in a hospital within and across countries. This suggests that different strategies are needed to effectively enable poor women and women living in remote areas to gain access to skilled and adequate care for childbirth. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy is an underlying cause of maternal deaths, and reducing risk through routine iron supplementation is a key component of antenatal care ({ANC}) programs in most low- and middle income countries. Supplementation coverage during pregnancy is estimated from maternal self-reports in population-based household surveys, yet recall bias and social desirability bias lead to errors of unknown magnitude. Methods: We linked data from household and health facility surveys from 16 countries to estimate input-adjusted coverage of iron supplementation during pregnancy. We assessed the validity of reported receipt of iron supplements in client exit interviews using direct observation as the gold standard across 9 countries with a recent Service Provision Assessment ({SPA}). Using a sample of 227 women who participated in the Nepal Oil Massage Study ({NOMS}), we also assessed the validity of self-reported receipt of iron folic acid ({IFA}) supplements. We used Poisson regression models to explore the association between client and health facility characteristics and agreement of self-reported receipt of iron supplements compared to direct observation. Results: Across the 16 countries, iron supplements were in supply at most of the 9215 sampled health facilities offering {ANC} services (91\%). We estimated that between 48 and 93\% of women attended at least one {ANC} visit at a health facility with iron supplements available. The specificity of recall of receipt of iron supplementation immediately following a visit was 79.3\% and the sensitivity was 88.7\% for the entire sample. Individual-level accuracy was high (Area under the curve {\textgreater} 0.7) and population bias low (0.75 {\textless} inflation factor {\textless} 1.25) across all countries. By contrast, in the {NOMS} sub-study, the accuracy of self-reported receipt of {IFA} supplements after 1-2 years was poor (sensitivity 86.1\%, specificity 34.3\%). Adjusted regression analyses indicated that older age and higher level of education were associated with poorer agreement between self-reports and direct observation. Conclusions: These findings suggest the need for caution when using self-reported measures with an extended recall period. Further validation studies using conditions similar to widely used population-based household surveys are warranted. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction: Poor access to quality healthcare is one of the most important reasons of high maternal and neonatal mortality in India, particularly in poorer states like Bihar. India has implemented initiatives to promote institutional maternal deliveries. It is important to ensure that health facilities are adequately equipped and staffed to provide quality care for mothers and newborns. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 190 primary health centres ({PHCs}) and 36 district hospitals ({DHs}) across all districts in Bihar to assess the readiness of facilities to provide quality maternal and neonatal care. Infrastructure, equipment and supplies and staffing were assessed using the {WHO} service availability and readiness assessment and Indian public health standard guidelines. Additionally, we used household survey data to assess the quality of care reported by mothers delivering at study facilities. Results: {PHCs} and {DHs} were found to have 61\% and 67\% of the mandated structural components to provide maternal and neonatal care, on average, respectively. {DHs} were, on average, slightly better equipped in terms of infrastructure, equipment and supplies by comparison to {PHCs}. {DHs} were found to be inadequately prepared to provide neonatal care. Lack of recommended handwashing stations and bins at both {DHs} and {PHCs} suggested low levels of hygiene. Only half of the essential drugs were available in both {DHs} and {PHCs}. While no association was revealed between structural capacity and patient-reported quality of care, adequacy of staffing was positively associated with the quality of care in {DHs}. Conclusion: Examining all {DHs} and a representative sample of {PHCs} in Bihar, this study revealed the gaps in structural components that need to be filled to provide quality care to mothers and newborns. Access to quality care is essential if progress in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality is to be achieved in this high-burden state. © 2019 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Incidence of breast cancer has increased in Vietnam over the past two decades, but little data exists to inform policy and planning. This study examined the organisation and delivery of breast cancer services in Vietnam in order to address the lack of data on detection, diagnosis and treatment. Methods: We gathered quantitative and qualitative data using an adapted survey-based Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) tool and semi-structured interviews from healthcare providers in 69 healthcare facilities about the experience and challenges of delivering breast cancer services. We conducted our study across four levels of the health system in three provinces in Vietnam. Results: The analysis of our data show that a number of areas require strengthening particularly in relation to service availability and service readiness. Firstly, healthcare providers across all levels of the health system reported that service provision was constrained by a lack of resources both in relation to health infrastructure and training for healthcare providers. Secondly, access to timely diagnosis and treatment is limited due to services only being available at the top two levels of the health system. Women living outside the immediate vicinity of such facilities tend to find access more costly and time-consuming, and there is a need to investigate the social, economic, geographic and cultural barriers that may prevent women from accessing services. Conclusions: Our study suggests that there is a need to strengthen lower levels of the Vietnamese health system in relation to the detection of breast cancer. Provision of some services such as clinical breast examination, advice on self-examination, and conducting ultrasound tests (supported with appropriate training and capacity-building of healthcare providers) at commune and district levels of the health system may reduce the overcrowding and service-delivery burden experienced in provincial and national-level hospitals. Empowering lower levels of the health system to conduct breast cancer screening, which is currently undertaken on an ad hoc basis through higher-level facilities, is likely to improve access to services for women. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background Geospatial data are important in monitoring many aspects of healthcare development. Geographically linking health facility data with population data is an important area of public health research. Examining healthcare problems spatially and hierarchically assists with efficient resource allocation and the monitoring and evaluation of service efficacy at different levels. This paper explored methodological issues associated with geographic data linkage, and the spatial and multilevel analyses that could be considered in analysing maternal health service data. Methods The 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey and the 2014 Ethiopia Service Provision Assessment data were used. Two geographic data linking methods were used to link these two datasets. Administrative boundary link was used to link a sample of health facilities data with population survey data for analysing three areas of maternal health service use. Euclidean buffer link was used for a census of hospitals to analyse caesarean delivery use in Ethiopia. The Global Moran’s I and the Getis-Ord Gi* statistics need to be carried out for identifying hot spots of maternal health service use in {ArcGIS} software. In addition to this, since the two datasets contain hierarchical data, a multilevel analysis was carried out to identify key determinants of maternal health service use in Ethiopia. Results Administrative boundary link gave more types of health facilities and more maternal health services as compared to the Euclidean buffer link. Administrative boundary link is the method of choice in case of sampled health facilities. However, for a census of health facilities, the Euclidean buffer link is the appropriate choice as this provides cluster level service environment estimates, which the administrative boundary link does not. Applying a False Discovery Rate correction enables the identification of true spatial clusters of maternal health service use. Conclusions A service environment link minimizes the methodological issues associated with geographic data linkage. A False Discovery Rate correction needs to be used to account for multiple and dependent testing while carrying out local spatial statistics. Examining maternal health service use both spatially and hierarchically has tremendous importance for identifying geographic areas that need special emphasis and for intervention purposes.},

To achieve the goal of strengthening entire health systems, surgery, as a crosscutting treatment modality, is indispensable. For any health system strengthening exercise, baseline data and longitudinal monitoring of progress are necessary. With improved data capabilities, there are unparalleled possibilities to map out and understand systems, integrating data from many sources and sectors. Nevertheless, there is also a need to prioritize among indicators to avoid information overload and data collection fatigue. There is a similar need to define indicators and collection methodology to create standardized and comparable data. Finally, there is a need to establish data pathways to ensure clear responsibilities amongst national and international institutions and integrate surgical metrics into existing mechanisms for sustainable data collection.

	abstract = {Introduction The growing use of Geographic Information Systems ({GIS}) to link population-level data to health facility data is key for the inclusion of health system environments in analyses of health disparities. However, such approaches commonly focus on just a couple of aspects of the health system environment and only report on the average and independent effect of each dimension. Methods Using {GIS} to link Demographic and Health Survey data on births (2008-13/14) to Service Availability and Readiness Assessment data on health facilities (2010) in Zambia, this paper rigorously measures the multiple dimensions of an accessible health system environment. Using multilevel Bayesian methods (multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy), it investigates whether multidimensional health system environments defined with reference to both geographic and social location cut across individual-level and community-level heterogeneity to reliably predict facility delivery. Results Random intercepts representing different health system environments have an intraclass correlation coefficient of 25\%, which demonstrates high levels of discriminatory accuracy. Health system environments with four or more access barriers are particularly likely to predict lower than average access to facility delivery. Including barriers related to geographic location in the non-random part of the model results in a proportional change in variance of 74\% relative to only 27\% for barriers related to social discrimination. Conclusions Health system environments defined as a combination of geographic and social location can effectively distinguish between population groups with high versus low probabilities of access. Barriers related to geographic location appear more important than social discrimination in the context of Zambian maternal healthcare access. Under a progressive universalism approach, resources should be disproportionately invested in the worst health system environments. © 2020 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

	abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess surgical availability and readiness in 8 African countries using the {WHO}'s Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) tool. Setting: We analysed data for surgical services, including basic and comprehensive surgery, comprehensive obstetric care, blood transfusion, and infection prevention, obtained from the {WHO}'s {SARA} surveys in Sierra Leone, Uganda, Mauritania, Benin, Zambia, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo and Togo. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Among the facilities that were expected to offer surgical services (N=3492), there were wide disparities between the countries in the number of facilities per 100 000 population that reported offering basic surgery (1.0-12.1), comprehensive surgery (0.1-0.8), comprehensive obstetric care (0.1-0.8) and blood transfusion (0.1-0.8). Only 0.1-0.3 facilities per 100 000 population had all three bellwether procedures available, namely laparotomy, open fracture management and caesarean section. In all the countries, the facilities that reported offering surgical services generally had a shortage of the necessary items for offering the services and this varied greatly between the countries, with the facilities having on average 27-53\% of the items necessary for offering basic surgery, 56-83\% for comprehensive surgery, 49-72\% for comprehensive obstetric care and 54-80\% for blood transfusion. Furthermore, few facilities had all the necessary items present. However, facilities that reported offering surgical services had on average most of the necessary items for the prevention of infection. Conclusions: There are important gaps in the surgical services in the 8 African countries surveyed. Efforts are therefore urgently needed to address deficiencies in the availability and readiness to deliver surgical services in these nations, and this will require commitment from multiple stakeholders. {SARA} may be used to monitor availability and readiness at regular intervals, which will enable stakeholders to evaluate progress and identify gaps and areas for improvement.},

	abstract = {Background: {WHO} and {UNICEF} have proposed an action plan to achieve universal water, sanitation and hygiene ({WASH}) coverage in healthcare facilities ({HCFs}) by 2030. The {WASH} targets and indicators for {HCFs} include: an improved water source on the premises accessible to all users, basic sanitation facilities, a hand washing facility with soap and water at all sanitation facilities and patient care areas. To establish viable targets for {WASH} in {HCFs}, investigation beyond 'access' is needed to address the state of {WASH} infrastructure and service provision. Patient and caregiver use of {WASH} services is largely unaddressed in previous studies despite being critical for infection control. Methods: The state of {WASH} services used by staff, patients and caregivers was assessed in 17 rural {HCFs} in Rwanda. Site selection was non-random and predicated upon piped water and power supply. Direct observation and semi-structured interviews assessed drinking water treatment, presence and condition of sanitation facilities, provision of soap and water, and {WASH}-related maintenance and record keeping. Samples were collected from water sources and treated drinking water containers and analyzed for total coliforms, E. coli, and chlorine residual. Results: Drinking water treatment was reported at 15 of 17 sites. Three of 18 drinking water samples collected met the {WHO} guideline for free chlorine residual of {\textgreater}0.2 mg/l, 6 of 16 drinking water samples analyzed for total coliforms met the {WHO} guideline of {\textless}1 coliform/100 {mL} and 15 of 16 drinking water samples analyzed for E. coli met the {WHO} guideline of {\textless}1 E. coli/100 {mL}. {HCF} staff reported treating up to 20 L of drinking water per day. At all sites, 60\% of water access points (160 of 267) were observed to be functional, 32\% of hand washing locations (46 of 142) had water and soap and 44\% of sanitary facilities (48 of 109) were in hygienic condition and accessible to patients. Regular maintenance of {WASH} infrastructure consisted of cleaning; no {HCF} had on-site capacity for performing repairs. Quarterly evaluations of {HCFs} for Rwanda's Performance Based Financing system included {WASH} indicators. Conclusions: All {HCFs} met national policies for water access, but {WHO} guidelines for environmental standards including water quality were not fully satisfied. Access to {WASH} services at the {HCFs} differed between staff and patients and caregivers. © 2017 The Author(s).},

This study used standardized, nationally representative data from Service Provision Assessments conducted in 2013-15 and the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment methodology to examine {NCD} service availability and readiness in Bangladesh, Haiti, Malawi, Nepal, and Tanzania. Both service availability and readiness were found to be very low: Very few facilities were fully "ready" to provide any one {NCD} service. Shortages of trained health workers and essential medicines were critical limitations to readiness. Rural and free facilities had lower availability and readiness, which may present access barriers. Policy makers should draw on decades of experience with global health initiatives to close these service gaps through the training of health workers on {NCD} screening and treatment, engaging the private sector on {NCDs}, and ensuring access to {NCD} medicines.

The study was done in 2 steps. First, the heads of the 21 {CHCs} of Quoc Oai district were interviewed using {SARA}, a quantitative survey, and the responses were then validated by direct observations of each facility. The results showed that although the average number of health staffs in each {CHC} met the national standards (at least 5 staffs per {CHC}), its allocation within each {CHC} was not properly met because some {CHCs} had only 2 health staffs. Several health equipment and facilities were not fully available in many {CHCs}, and although the majority of the {PHC} services were available at the {CHCs}, their readiness remained limited. Several significant correlates between the availability of health care workers and the availability of the facilities and the {PHC} services were observed, suggesting that they depend upon and affect one another in the health system. Using the {SARA}-based inventory, the study helps health managers and policy makers to prioritize efforts and allocate resources more appropriately. To be effective, attention should be given to how to make facilities, services, and human resources for health ready for {PHC} activities—more investment and support from the system (from higher to lower level) and the government.

Here, we conduct a modelling study triangulating household survey data for fever in children under the age of five years with georeferenced public health facility databases (n = 86,442 facilities) in 29 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, to estimate the probability of seeking treatment for fever at public facilities. A Bayesian item response theory framework is used to estimate this probability based on reported fever episodes, treatment choice, residence, and estimated travel-time to the nearest public-sector health facility. Findings show inter- and intra-country variation, with the likelihood of seeking treatment for fever less than 50\% in 16 countries. Results highlight the need to invest in public healthcare and related databases.

	abstract = {Objective To analyse factors affecting variations in the observed quality of antenatal and sick-child care in primary-care facilities in seven African countries. Methods We pooled nationally representative data from service provision assessment surveys of health facilities in Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania (survey year range: 2006–2014). Based on World Health Organization protocols, we created indices of process quality for antenatal care (first visits) and for sick-child visits. We assessed national, facility, provider and patient factors that might explain variations in quality of care, using separate multilevel regression models of quality for each service. Findings Data were available for 2594 and 11 402 observations of clinical consultations for antenatal care and sick children, respectively. Overall, health-care providers performed a mean of 62.2\% (interquartile range, {IQR}: 50.0 to 75.0) of eight recommended antenatal care actions and 54.5\% ({IQR}: 33.3 to 66.7) of nine sick-child care actions at observed visits. Quality of antenatal care was higher in better-staffed and -equipped facilities and lower for physicians and clinical officers than nurses. Experienced providers and those in better-managed facilities provided higher quality sick-child care, with no differences between physicians and nurses or between better- and less-equipped clinics. Private facilities outperformed public facilities. Country differences were more influential in explaining variance in quality than all other factors combined. Conclusion The quality of two essential primary-care services for women and children was weak and varied across and within the countries. Analysis of reasons for variations in quality could identify strategies for improving care. © 2017, World Health Organization. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective: Despite much progress in maternal health service coverage, the quality of care has not seen parallel improvement. This study assessed the quality of antenatal care ({ANC}), an entry point to the health system for many women. Design: The study used data from recent Service Provision Assessment ({SPA}) surveys of nationally representative health facilities in Kenya and Namibia. Setting: Kenya and Namibia represent the situation in much of sub-Saharan Africa, where {ANC} is relatively common but maternal mortality remains high. Participants: The {SPA} comprised an inventory of health facilities that provided {ANC}, interviews with {ANC} providers and clients, and observations of service delivery. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Quality was measured in terms of structure and process of service provision, and client satisfaction as the outcome of service provision. Results: Wide variations in structural and process attributes of quality of care existed in both Kenya and Namibia; however, better structural quality did not translate to better service delivery process or greater client satisfaction. Long waiting time was a common problem and was generally more serious in hospitals and health centers than in clinics and smaller facilities; it was consistently associated with lower client satisfaction. The study also indicates that the provider's technical preparedness may not be sufficient to provide good-quality services and to ensure client satisfaction. Conclusions: Findings highlight important program implications, including improving {ANC} services and promoting their use at health clinics and lower-level facilities, and ensuring that available supplies and equipment are used for service provision. © The Author 2017.},

	abstract = {Background: Quality of healthcare is an important determinant of future progress in global health. However, the distributional aspects of quality of care have received inadequate attention. We assessed whether high quality maternal care is equitably distributed by (1) mapping the quality of maternal care in facilities located in poorer versus wealthier areas of Kenya; and (2) comparing the quality of maternal care available to Kenyans in and not in poverty. Methods: We assessed three measures of maternal care quality: facility infrastructure and clinical quality of antenatal care and delivery care, using indicators from the 2010 Kenya Service Provision Assessment ({SPA}), a standardized facility survey with direct observation of maternal care provision. We calculated poverty of the area served by antenatal or delivery care facilities using the Multidimensional Poverty Index. We used regression analyses and nonparametric tests to assess differences in maternal care quality in facilities located in more and less impoverished areas. We estimated effective coverage with a minimum standard of care for the full population and those in poverty. Results: A total of 564 facilities offering at least one maternal care service were included in this analysis. Quality of maternal care was low, particularly clinical quality of antenatal and delivery care, which averaged 0.52 and 0.58 out of 1 respectively, compared to 0.68 for structural inputs to care. Maternal healthcare quality varied by poverty level: at the facility level, all quality metrics were lowest for the most impoverished areas and increased significantly with greater wealth. Population access to a minimum standard (≥0.75 of 1.00) of quality maternal care was both low and inequitable: only 17\% of all women and 8\% of impoverished women had access to minimally adequate delivery care. Conclusion: The quality of maternal care is low in Kenya, and care available to the impoverished is significantly worse than that for the better off. To achieve the national targets of maternal and neonatal mortality reduction, policy initiatives need to tackle low quality of care, starting with high-poverty areas. Copyright: © 2017 Sharma et al.

	abstract = {Injury is a leading cause of the global disease burden, accounting for 10 percent of all deaths worldwide. Despite 90 percent of these deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries ({LMICs}), the majority of trauma research and infrastructure development has taken place in high-income settings. Furthermore, although accessible services are of central importance to a mature trauma system, there remains a paucity of literature describing the spatial accessibility of emergency services in {LMICs}. Using data from the Service Provision Assessment component of the Demographic and Health Surveys of Namibia and Haiti we defined the capabilities of healthcare facilities in each country in terms of their preparedness to provide emergency services. A Geographic Information System-based network analysis method was used to define 5- 10- and 50-kilometer catchment areas for all facilities capable of providing 24-hour care, higher-level resuscitative services or tertiary care. The proportion of a country's population with access to each level of service was obtained by amalgamating the catchment areas with a population layer. A significant proportion of the population of both countries had poor spatial access to lower level services with 25\% of the population of Haiti and 51\% of the population of Namibia living further than 50 kilometers from a facility capable of providing 24-hour care. Spatial access to tertiary care was considerably lower with 51\% of Haitians and 72\% of Namibians having no access to these higher-level services within 50 kilometers. These results demonstrate a significant disparity in potential spatial access to emergency services in two {LMICs} compared to analogous estimates from high-income settings, and suggest that strengthening the capabilities of existing facilities may improve the equity of emergency services in these countries. Routine collection of georeferenced patient and facility data in {LMICs} will be important to understanding how spatial access to services influences outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background: Inadequate water and sanitation during childbirth are likely to lead to poor maternal and newborn outcomes. This paper uses existing data sources to assess the water and sanitation ({WATSAN}) environment surrounding births in Tanzania in order to interrogate whether such estimates could be useful for guiding research, policy and monitoring initiatives. Methods: We used the most recent Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}) to characterise the delivery location of births occurring between 2005 and 2010. Births occurring in domestic environments were characterised as {WATSAN}-safe if the home fulfilled international definitions of improved water and improved sanitation access. We used the 2006 Service Provision Assessment survey to characterise the {WATSAN} environment of facilities that conduct deliveries. We combined estimates from both surveys to describe the proportion of all births occurring in {WATSAN}-safe environments and conducted an equity analysis based on {DHS} wealth quintiles and eight geographic zones. Results: 42.9\% (95\% confidence interval: 41.6\%-44.2\%) of all births occurred in the woman's home. Among these, only 1.5\% (95\% confidence interval: 1.2\%-2.0\%) were estimated to have taken place in {WATSAN}-safe conditions. 74\% of all health facilities conducted deliveries. Among these, only 44\% of facilities overall and 24\% of facility delivery rooms were {WATSAN}-safe. Combining the estimates, we showed that 30.5\% of all births in Tanzania took place in a {WATSAN}-safe environment (range of uncertainty 25\%-42\%). Large wealth-based inequalities existed in the proportion of births occurring in domestic environments based on wealth quintile and geographical zone. Conclusion: Existing data sources can be useful in national monitoring and prioritisation of interventions to improve poor {WATSAN} environments during childbirth. However, a better conceptual understanding of potentially harmful exposures and better data are needed in order to devise and apply more empirical definitions of {WATSAN}-safe environments, both at home and in facilities.},

	abstract = {Background Global efforts to increase births at health-care facilities might not reduce maternal or newborn mortality if quality of care is insufficient. However, little systematic evidence exists for the quality at health facilities caring for women and newborn babies in low-income countries. We analysed the quality of basic maternal care functions and its association with volume of deliveries and surgical capacity in health-care facilities in five sub-Saharan African countries. Methods In this analysis, we combined nationally representative health system surveys (Service Provision Assessments by the Demographic and Health Survery Programme) with data for volume of deliveries and quality of delivery care from Kenya, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. We measured the quality of basic maternal care functions in delivery facilities using an index of 12 indicators of structure and processes of care, including infrastructure and use of evidence-based routine and emergency care interventions. We regressed the quality index on volume of births and confounders (public or privately managed, availability of antiretroviral therapy services, availability of skilled staffing, and country) stratified by facility type: primary (no caesarean capacity) or secondary (has caesarean capacity) care facilities. The Harvard University Human Research Protection Program approved this analysis as exempt from human subjects review. Findings The national surveys were completed between April, 2006, and May, 2010. Our sample consisted of 1715 (93\%) of 1842 health-care facilities that provided normal delivery service, after exclusion of facilities with missing (n=126) or invalid (n=1) data. 1511 (88\%) study facilities (site of 276 965 [44\%] of 622 864 facility births) did not have caesarean section capacity (primary care facilities). Quality of basic maternal care functions was substantially lower in primary (index score 0·38) than secondary care facilities (0·77). Low delivery volume was consistently associated with poor quality, with differences in quality between the lowest versus highest volume facilities of −0·22 (95\% {CI} −0·26 to −0·19) in primary care facilities and −0·17 (−0·21 to −0·11) in secondary care facilities. Interpretation More than 40\% of facility deliveries in these five African countries occurred in primary care facilities, which scored poorly on basic measures of maternal care quality. Facilities with caesarean section capacity, particularly those with birth volumes higher than 500 per year, had higher scores for maternal care quality. Low-income and middle-income countries should systematically assess and improve the quality of delivery care in health facilities to accelerate reduction of maternal and newborn deaths.

Methods The {SARA} is a comprehensive approach for assessing and monitoring health service availability and the readiness of facilities to deliver health-care interventions, with a standardized set of indicators that cover all main programmes. Standardized data-collection instruments are used to gather information on a defned set of selected tracer items from public and private health facilities through a facility sample survey or census. Results from assessments in six countries are shown. Findings The results highlight important gaps in service delivery that are obstacles to universal access to health services. Considerable variation was found within and across countries in the distribution of health facility infrastructure and workforce and in the types of services ofered. Weaknesses in laboratory diagnostic capacities and gaps in essential medicines and commodities were common across all countries.

	abstract = {Background: Access to electricity is critical to health care delivery and to the overarching goal of universal health coverage. Data on electricity access in health care facilities are rarely collected and have never been reported systematically in a multi-country study. We conducted a systematic review of available national data on electricity access in health care facilities in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We identified publicly-available data from nationally representative facility surveys through a systematic review of articles in {PubMed}, as well as through websites of development agencies, ministries of health, and national statistics bureaus. To be included in our analysis, data sets had to be collected in or after 2000, be nationally representative of a sub-Saharan African country, cover both public and private health facilities, and include a clear definition of electricity access. Results: We identified 13 health facility surveys from 11 sub-Saharan African countries that met our inclusion criteria. On average, 26\% of health facilities in the surveyed countries reported no access to electricity. Only 28\% of health care facilities, on average, had reliable electricity among the 8 countries reporting data. Among 9 countries, an average of 7\% of facilities relied solely on a generator. Electricity access in health care facilities increased by 1.5\% annually in Kenya between 2004 and 2010, and by 4\% annually in Rwanda between 2001 and 2007. Conclusions: Energy access for health care facilities in sub-Saharan African countries varies considerably. An urgent need exists to improve the geographic coverage, quality, and frequency of data collection on energy access in health care facilities. Standardized tools should be used to collect data on all sources of power and supply reliability. The United Nations Secretary-General's "Sustainable Energy for All" initiative provides an opportunity to comprehensively monitor energy access in health care facilities. Such evidence about electricity needs and gaps would optimize use of limited resources, which can help to strengthen health systems. © Adair-Rohani et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Ending preventable newborn deaths is a global health priority, but efforts to improve coverage of maternal and newborn care have not yielded expected gains in infant survival in many settings. One possible explanation is poor quality of clinical care. We assess facility quality and estimate the association of facility quality with neonatal mortality in Malawi. Methods and Findings: Data on facility infrastructure as well as processes of routine and basic emergency obstetric care for all facilities in the country were obtained from 2013 Malawi Service Provision Assessment. Birth location and mortality for children born in the preceding two years were obtained from the 2013–2014 Millennium Development Goals Endline Survey. Facilities were classified as higher quality if they ranked in the top 25\% of delivery facilities based on an index of 25 predefined quality indicators. To address risk selection (sicker mothers choosing or being referred to higher-quality facilities), we employed instrumental variable ({IV}) analysis to estimate the association of facility quality of care with neonatal mortality. We used the difference between distance to the nearest facility and distance to a higher-quality delivery facility as the instrument. Four hundred sixty-seven of the 540 delivery facilities in Malawi, including 134 rated as higher quality, were linked to births in the population survey. The difference between higher- and lower-quality facilities was most pronounced in indicators of basic emergency obstetric care procedures. Higher-quality facilities were located a median distance of 3.3 km further from women than the nearest delivery facility and were more likely to be in urban areas. Among the 6,686 neonates analyzed, the overall neonatal mortality rate was 17 per 1,000 live births. Delivery in a higher-quality facility (top 25\%) was associated with a 2.3 percentage point lower newborn mortality (95\% confidence interval [{CI}] -0.046, 0.000, p-value 0.047). These results imply a newborn mortality rate of 28 per 1,000 births at low-quality facilities and of 5 per 1,000 births at the top 25\% of facilities, accounting for maternal and newborn characteristics. This estimate applies to newborns whose mothers would switch from a lower-quality to a higher-quality facility if one were more accessible. Although we did not find an indication of unmeasured associations between the instrument and outcome, this remains a potential limitation of {IV} analysis. Conclusions: Poor quality of delivery facilities is associated with higher risk of newborn mortality in Malawi. A shift in focus from increasing utilization of delivery facilities to improving their quality is needed if global targets for further reductions in newborn mortality are to be achieved. © 2016 Leslie et al.},

	abstract = {The concept of contraceptive method choice is complex and difficult to measure, usually requiring multiple metrics that represent the service environment, access, and acceptability. One of the most used measures for the family planning service delivery environment is method availability, or specifically, the contraceptive options that are available to clients at any given family planning service delivery point. Despite the importance of the measure, indicator definitions vary widely and are not standardized. We identified six versions of the method availability indicator and calculated each version using Service Provision Assessment data from three countries with varying family planning profiles, health service structures, and from different geographic areas: Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Haiti. We compared method availability estimates by urban/rural location, facility type, and across country context. Our results showed a wide variability in method availability estimates depending on the indicator used. Generally, indicators requiring a particular mix of method types had lower estimates of method availability than indicators only requiring a minimum number of methods. Results are discussed and recommendations are made to standardize indicator language and guidance. We further recommend the standardization of an indicator with a minimum mix of method types to ensure that a variety of method preferences can be met.},

	abstract = {Labor migration is widespread and growing across the world. As migration grows, the economic outcomes of migration increasingly diversify, and so do its consequences for the well-being and health of both migrants and non-migrating household members. A considerable body of scholarship has examined the effects of migration on the physical and mental health of ‘left-behind’ household members. The impact of migration on mortality, particularly of non-migrating marital partners, is less well understood. Addressing this gap, we use data from a longitudinal survey of married women conducted over twelve years in rural Mozambique to examine the association between men's labor out-migration and their non-migrating wives' mortality. The analyses detect no significant differences when comparing non-migrants' wives to migrants' wives in the aggregate but point to instructive variation among migrants' wives according to the economic success of migration, as measured by the effects of migration on the household's material well-being. Specifically, women married to less successful migrants had higher mortality risks over the project span than women married to more successful migrants, regardless of other individual and household-level factors. Importantly for this setting with high {HIV} prevalence, the advantage of wives of more successful migrants is significant for {HIV}/{AIDS}-unrelated deaths but not for {HIV}/{AIDS}-related deaths. We situate these findings within the cross-national scholarship on migration and health.},

General service and malaria-specific readiness indicators were obtained from the 2013 Uganda service delivery indicator survey.

	abstract = {Background
              Actionable information about the readiness of health facilities is needed to inform quality improvement efforts in maternity care, but there is no consensus on the best approach to measure readiness. Many countries use the {WHO}’s Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) or the Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}) Programme’s Service Provision Assessment to measure facility readiness. This study compares measures of childbirth service readiness based on {SARA} and {DHS} guidance to an index based on {WHO}’s quality of maternal and newborn care standards.
            
            
              Methods
              We used cross-sectional data from Performance Monitoring for Action Ethiopia’s 2019 survey of 406 health facilities providing childbirth services. We calculated childbirth service readiness scores using items based on {SARA}, {DHS} and {WHO} standards. For each, we used three aggregation methods for generating indices: simple addition, domain-weighted addition and principal components analysis. We compared central tendency, spread and item variation between the readiness indices; concordance between health facility scores and rankings; and correlations between readiness scores and delivery volume.
            
            
              Results
              Indices showed moderate agreement with one another, and all had a small but significant positive correlation with monthly delivery volume. Ties were more frequent for indices with fewer items. More than two-thirds of items in the relatively shorter {SARA} and {DHS} indices were widely ({\textgreater}90\%) available in hospitals, and half of the {SARA} items were widely ({\textgreater}90\%) available in health centres/clinics. Items based on the {WHO} standards showed greater variation and captured unique aspects of readiness (eg, quality improvement processes, actionable information systems) not included in either the {SARA} or {DHS} indices.
            
            
              Conclusion
              {SARA} and {DHS} indices rely on a small set of widely available items to assess facility readiness to provide childbirth care. Expanded selection of items based on the {WHO} standards can better differentiate between levels of service readiness.},

Result Our analysis showed that basic structure items such as connection to electricity grid, manual vacuum extractors, vacuum aspirators and dilation and curettage kits were widely unavailable at healthcare facilities. There was a significant improvement in indicators of structure (P ¡ 0.001) and {BEmOC} (P = 0.03) in primary facilities; however, there was no significant change in the quality of {CEmOC} in primary facilities (P = 0.18).

	abstract = {Background Population-based measures of intervention coverage are used in low- and middle-income countries for program planning, prioritization, and evaluation. There is increased interest in effective coverage, which integrates information about service quality or health outcomes. Approaches proposed for quality-adjusted effective coverage include linking data on need and service contact from population-based surveys with data on service quality from health facility surveys. However, there is limited evidence about the validity of different linking methods for effective coverage estimation. Methods We collaborated with the 2016 Côte d'Ivoire Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey ({MICS}) to link data from a health provider assessment to care-seeking data collected by the {MICS} in the Savanes region of Côte d'Ivoire. The provider assessment was conducted in a census of public and non-public health facilities and pharmacies in Savanes in May-June 2016. We also included community health workers managing sick children who served the clusters sampled for the {MICS}. The provider assessment collected information on structural and process quality for antenatal care, delivery and immediate newborn care, postnatal care, and sick child care. We linked the {MICS} and provider data using exact-match and ecological linking methods, including aggregate linking and geolinking methods. We compared the results obtained from exact-match and ecological methods. Results We linked 731 of 786 care-seeking episodes (93\%) from the {MICS} to a structural quality score for the provider named by the respondent. Effective coverage estimates computed using exact-match methods were 13\%-63\% lower than the care-seeking estimates from the {MICS}. Absolute differences between exact match and ecological linking methods were ±7 percentage points for all ecological methods. Incorporating adjustments for provider category and weighting by service-specific utilization into the ecological methods generally resulted in better agreement between ecological and exact match estimates. Conclusions Ecological linking may be a feasible and valid approach for estimating quality-adjusted effective coverage when a census of providers is used. Adjusting for provider type and caseload may improve agreement with exact match results. There remain methodological questions to be addressed to develop guidance on using linking methods for estimating quality-adjusted effective coverage, including the effect of facility sampling and time displacement. © 2018, Journal of Health Global.},

	abstract = {Background Measurement of Emergency Obstetric Care capability is common, and measurement of newborn and overall routine childbirth care has begun in recent years. These assessments of facility capabilities can be used to identify geographic inequalities in access to functional health services and to monitor improvements over time. This paper develops an approach for monitoring the childbirth environment that accounts for the delivery caseload of the facility. Methods We used data from the Kenya Service Provision Assessment to examine facility capability to provide quality childbirth care, including infrastructure, routine maternal and newborn care, and emergency obstetric and newborn care. A facility was considered capable of providing a function if necessary tracer items were present and, for emergency functions, if the function had been performed in the previous three months. We weighted facility capability by delivery caseload, and compared results with those generated using traditional “survey weights”. Results Of the 403 facilities providing childbirth care, the proportion meeting criteria for capability were: 13\% for general infrastructure, 6\% for basic emergency obstetric care, 3\% for basic emergency newborn care, 13\% and 11\% for routine maternal and newborn care, respectively. When the new caseload weights accounting for delivery volume were applied, capability improved and the proportions of deliveries occurring in a facility meeting capability criteria were: 51\% for general infrastructure, 46\% for basic emergency obstetric care, 12\% for basic emergency newborn care, 36\% and 18\% for routine maternal and newborn care, respectively. This is because most of the caseload was in hospitals, which generally had better capability. Despite these findings, fewer than 2\% of deliveries occurred in a facility capable of providing all functions. Conclusion Reporting on the percentage of facilities capable of providing certain functions misrepresents the capacity to provide care at the national level. Delivery caseload weights allow adjustment for patient volume, and shift the denominator of measurement from facilities to individual deliveries, leading to a better representation of the context in which facility births take place. These methods could lead to more standardized national datasets, enhancing their ability to inform policy at a national and international level.},

Methods We obtained data on antibiotic availability at 13 561 health facilities in 13 service provision assessment and 8 service availability and readiness assessment surveys. In 10 service provision assessment surveys, child consultations with health-care providers were observed, giving data on antibiotic use in 22 699 children. Antibiotics were classified as access, watch or reserve, according to the World Health Organization's {AWaRe} categories. The percentage of health-care facilities across countries with specific antibiotics available and the proportion of children receiving antibiotics for key clinical syndromes were estimated. Findings The surveys assessed the availability of 27 antibiotics (19 access, 7 watch, 1 unclassified). Co-trimoxazole and metronidazole were most widely available, being in stock at 89.5\% (interquartile range, {IQR}: 11.6\%) and 87.1\% ({IQR}: 15.9\%) of health facilities, respectively. In contrast, 17 other access and watch antibiotics were stocked, by fewer than a median of 50\% of facilities. Of the 22 699 children observed, 60.1\% (13 638) were prescribed antibiotics (mostly co-trimoxazole or amoxicillin). Children with respiratory conditions were most often prescribed antibiotics (76.1\%; 8972/11 796) followed by undifferentiated fever (50.1\%; 760/1518), diarrhoea (45.7\%; 1293/2832) and malaria (30.3\%; 352/1160). Conclusion Routine health facility surveys provided a valuable data source on the availability and use of antibiotics in low- and middle-income countries.

The physical presence of service delivery, which includes health infrastructure, core health staff, and aspects of service use, is referred to as service availability. This study was conducted to inform the health service availability and preparedness to deliver {HIV}, {TB}, and malaria prevention and control services in Ekiti State. Methods: this is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among all the Primary Health Centres (177) in Ekiti State Nigeria between August and October 2020. Data were collected with the use of the World Health Organization Service Availability and Readiness Assessment tool and were analyzed using {STATA} {SE} 12. Results: close to half (49\%) of them had a condom in supply. More than 90\% of them provided diagnosis and treatment of malaria. The {HIV}-specific service readiness index was approximately 40/0\%. Only 26.6\% of health facilities were ready to offer {TB} prevention and control services. Malaria specific service readiness index was 61.9\%. There was a statistically significant difference in the {HIV} and {TB}-specific service readiness of facilities in the urban compared to rural locations. Health facilities located in the urban areas had higher mean readiness scores compared to those in the other residential areas (P=0.014). Conclusion: it is evident that {HIV} and {TB}-specific service readiness is very poor among {PHCs} in Ekiti State. Malaria Service Readiness was fair.

	abstract = {Background Further improvements in population health in low- and middle-income countries demand high-quality care to address an increasingly complex burden of disease. Health facility surveys provide an important but costly source of information on readiness to provide care. To improve the efficiency of health system measurement, we applied unsupervised machine learning methods to assess the performance of the service readiness index ({SRI}) defined by the World Health Organization and compared it to empirically derived indices. Methods We drew data from nationally representative Service Provision Assessment surveys conducted in 10 countries between 2007 and 2015. We extracted 649 items in domains such as infrastructure, medication, and management to calculate an index using all available information and classified facilities into quintiles. We compared three approaches against the full item set: the {SRI}, a new index based on sequential backward selection, and an enriched {SRI} that added empirically selected items to the {SRI}. We evaluated index performance with a cross-validated kappa statistic comparing classification using the candidate index against the 649-item index. Results 9238 facilities were assessed. The 49-item {SRI} performed poorly against the index using all 649 items, with a kappa value of 0.35. New empirically derived indices with 50 and 100 items captured much more information, with cross-validated kappa statistics of 0.71 and 0.80, respectively. Items varied across the indices and in sensitivity analyses. A 100-item enriched {SRI} reliably captured the information from the full index: 83\% of the facilities were classified into correct quintiles of service readiness based on the full index. Conclusion A facility readiness measure developed by global health experts performed poorly in capturing the totality of readiness information collected during facility surveys. Using a machine learning approach with sequential selection and cross-validation to identify the most informative items dramatically improved performance. Such approaches can make assessment of health facility readiness more efficient. Further improvements in measurement will require identification of external criteria—such as patient outcomes—to guide and validate measure development.},

              This study used a nationally representative sample from Tanzania as an example of low-resource setting with a high burden of maternal and newborn deaths, to assess the availability and readiness of health facilities to provide basic emergency obstetric and newborn care ({BEmONC}) and its associated factors.
            
            
              Design
              Health facility-based cross-sectional survey.
            
            
              Setting
              We analysed data for obstetric and newborn care services obtained from the 2014–2015 Tanzania Service Provision Assessment survey, using {WHO}-Service Availability and Readiness Assessment tool.
            
            
              Primary and secondary outcome measures
              Availability of seven signal functions was measured based on the provision of ‘parental administration of antibiotic’, ‘parental administration of oxytocic’, ‘parental administration of anticonvulsants’, ‘assisted vaginal delivery’, ‘manual removal of placenta’, ‘manual removal of retained products of conception’ and ‘neonatal resuscitation’. Readiness was a composite variable measured based on the availability of supportive items categorised into three domains: staff training, diagnostic equipment and basic medicines.
            
            
              Results
              Out of 1188 facilities, 905 (76.2\%) were reported to provide obstetric and newborn care services and therefore were included in the analysis of the current study. Overall availability of seven signal functions and average readiness score were consistently higher among hospitals than health centres and dispensaries (p{\textless}0.001). Furthermore, the type of facility, performing quality assurance, regular reviewing of maternal and newborn deaths, reviewing clients’ opinion and number of delivery beds per facility were significantly associated with readiness to provide {BEmONC}.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The study findings show disparities in the availability and readiness to provide {BEmONC} among health facilities in Tanzania. The Tanzanian Ministry of Health should emphasise quality assurance efforts and systematic maternal and newborn death audits. Health leadership should fairly distribute clinical guidelines, essential medicines, equipment and refresher trainings to improve availability and quality {BEmONC}.},

	abstract = {Objective
              Pneumonia is the single-leading cause of infectious disease deaths in children under-5. Despite this challenge, the utilisation of preventive and curative child health services remains low in Ethiopia. We investigated the association between health post service readiness and caregivers’ awareness of pneumonia services, care-seeking and utilisation of pneumonia-relevant immunisation in four Ethiopian regions.
            
            
              Design and setting
              This cross-sectional study was conducted in 52 districts of four regions of Ethiopia from December 2018 to February 2019. The health posts preparedness for sick child care was assessed using the {WHO} Health Service Availability and Readiness Assessment tool. Multilevel analyses were employed to examine the associations between health post readiness and household-level awareness and utilisation of services.
            
            
              Participants
              We included 165 health posts, 274 health extension workers (community health workers) and 4729 caregivers with 5787 children 2–59 months.
            
            
              Outcome measures
              Awareness of pneumonia treatment, care-seeking behaviour and coverage of pentavalent-3 immunisation.
            
            
              Results
              Only 62.8\% of health posts were ready to provide sick child care services. One-quarter of caregivers were aware of pneumonia services, and 56.8\% sought an appropriate care provider for suspected pneumonia. Nearly half (49.3\%) of children (12–23 months) had received pentavalent-3 immunisation. General health post readiness was not associated with caregivers’ awareness of pneumonia treatment (adjusted {OR}, {AOR} 0.9, 95\% {CI} 0.7 to 1.1) and utilisation of pentavalent-3 immunisation ({AOR}=1.2, 95\% {CI} 0.8 to 1.6), but negatively associated with care-seeking for childhood illnesses ({AOR}=0.6, 95\% {CI} 0.4 to 0.8).
            
            
              Conclusion
              We found no association between facility readiness and awareness or utilisation of child health services. There were significant deficiencies in health post preparedness for services. Caregivers had low awareness and utilisation of pneumonia-related services. The results underline the importance of enhancing facility preparedness, providing high-quality care and intensifying demand generation efforts to prevent and treat pneumonia.},

However, the mean readiness index of the healthcare system to manage {CVD} decreased from 26.8\% to 24.1\% (p for trend ¡0.001). This trend was observed mainly at the primary healthcare level (from 26.0\% to 21.6\%, p¡0.001). For diabetes, the readiness index increased (from 35.4\% to 41.1\%, p for trend=0.07) during 2012-2018. However, during the crisis period (2014-2018), both {CVD} (27.9\% to 24.1\%, p¡0.001) and diabetes (45.8\% to 41.1\%, p¡0.001) service readiness decreased. At the subnational level, the readiness index for {CVD} significantly decreased in all regions but predominantly in the Sahel region, which is the main insecure region (from 32.2\% to 22.6\%, p¡0.001).{ConclusionIn} this first monitoring study, we found a low level and decreased trend of readiness of the healthcare system for delivering cardiometabolic care, particularly during the crisis period and in conflicted regions. Policymakers should pay more attention to the impact of crises on the healthcare system to mitigate the rising burden of cardiometabolic diseases.},

	abstract = {The government of Nepal revised its law in 2002 to allow women to terminate a pregnancy up to 12 weeks gestation for any indication on request, and up to 18 weeks if certain conditions are met. We evaluated the readiness of facilities in Nepal to provide three abortion services, manual vacuum aspiration ({MVA}), medication abortion ({MA}) and post-abortion care ({PAC}), using the service availability and readiness assessment ({SARA}) framework. The framework consists broadly of three domains; service availability, general service readiness and service readiness specific to individual services (i.e. service-specific readiness). We applied the framework to data from the Nepal Health Facility Survey 2015, a nationally representative survey of 992 health facilities. Overall, we find that access to safe abortion remains limited in Nepal. Of the facilities that reported offering delivery services and were thus eligible to provide safe abortion services, 44.5, 36.0 and 25.6\% had provided any {MVA}, {MA} or {PAC} services, respectively, in the 3 months prior to the survey, and {\textless}2\% were 'ready' to provide any abortion service based on our application of the {SARA} criteria for service-specific readiness. Among only the facilities that reported providing an abortion service in the 3 months prior to the survey, 3.2\% of facilities that provided {MVA}, 1.5\% of facilities that provided {MA} and 1.1\% of the facilities that provided {PAC} had all the components of care required. Although the private sector conducted approximately half of all abortion services provided in the 3 months prior to the survey, no private sector facilities had all the abortion service-specific readiness components. Results suggest that accessing safe abortion services remains a significant challenge for Nepalese women, despite a set of permissive laws. © The Author 2017.

Integrating {PrEP} into maternal and child health ({MCH}) clinics is feasible and acceptable. Understanding clinics' service availability and readiness is essential for effective scale up. Methods: The {PrEP} in Pregnancy, Accelerating Reach and Efficiency study ({PrEPARE}; {NCT}04712994) engaged {PrEP}-experienced facilities previously linked to a programmatic or research study in Western Kenya to document available services and commodities via a modified service availability and readiness assessment ({SARA}) survey with 20 {PrEP} tracer items covering: staffing/guidelines, services/equipment, and medicines/commodities. Facilities' prior study engagement occurred between 2017 and 2019; {SARA} survey data was collected between April 2020 and June 2021. Descriptive statistics were stratified by prior study engagement. {ANOVA} tests assessed associations between facility characteristics and gaps. Fisher's tests assessed differences in commodity availability and stockouts. Results: Of the 55 facilities surveyed, 60\% had received {PrEP} training in the last two years, 95\% offered {PrEP} integrated into {MCH}, and 64\% and 78\% had both auditory and visual privacy in {PrEP} and {HIV} testing service ({HTS}) delivery spaces, respectively. Supervision frequency was heterogeneous, but 82\% had received a supervision visit within 3 months. Availability of commodities was variable and the most commonly unavailable commodities were {PrEP} in {MCH} (71\% available) and risk assessment screening tool ({RAST}) and {PrEP} cards (60\% and 75\% available, respectively). The number of service and commodity gaps per facility ranged from zero to eight (median: 3; {IQR}: 2, 5). The most frequent gaps were: {PrEP} training and risk assessment cards (40\% each), lack of privacy in {PrEP} (36\%) and {HIV} testing services (31\%) spaces, {PrEP} pills in {MCH} (29\%), and {PrEP} cards (25\%). There were no differences in mean number of gaps by county, previous study engagement, or public vs. private status. Level 4 facilities had fewer gaps (mean 2.2) than level 2, 3, and 5 facilities (mean 5.7, 4.5, and 5.3 respectively; p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: {PrEP} service availability and readiness was generally high across {MCH} facilities. However, there is a need for increased frequency of provider training and supportive supervision focused on fidelity. To address key commodity stockouts such as {PrEP} pills, implementation of electronic logistics management information systems may be needed. Targeting these gaps is essential to effectively scale up integrated {PrEP} delivery, especially among facilities with limited infrastructure. 2023 Hicks, Abuna, Odhiambo, Dettinger, Sila, Oketch, Sifuna, Ngumbau, Gómez, John-Stewart, Kinuthia and Wagner.},

We assessed service availability, service readiness and factors influencing service delivery at public {PHC} centres in Enugu State, Nigeria. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 60 randomly selected public health centres in Enugu using the World Health Organization's Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) survey. The most senior health worker available was interviewed using the {SARA} questionnaire, and an observational checklist was used for the facility assessment. None of the {PHC} centres surveyed had all the recommended service domains, but 52 (87\%) offered at least half of the recommended service domains. Newborn care and immunization (98.3\%) were the most available services across facilities, while mental health was the least available service (36.7\%). None of the surveyed facilities had a functional ambulance or access to a computer on the day of the assessment. The specific-service readiness score was lowest in the non-communicable disease ({NCD}) area (33\% in the rural health centres and 29\% in the urban health centres) and {NCD} medicines and supplies. Availability of medicine and supplies was also low in rural {PHC} centres for the communicable disease area (36\%) and maternal health services (38\%). Basic equipment was significantly more available in urban health centres (P = 0.02). Urban location of facilities and the presence of a medical officer were found to be associated with having at least 50\% of the recommended infrastructure / basic amenities and equipment. Continuing medical education, funding and security were identified by the health workers as key enablers of service delivery. In conclusion, despite a focus on expanding primary care in Enugu State, significant gaps exist that need to be closed for {PHC} to make significant contributions towards achieving universal healthcare, core to achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goal agenda.},

	abstract = {Pay-for-performance (P4P) programmes have been introduced in numerous developing countries with the goal of increasing the provision and quality of health services through financial incentives. Despite the popularity of P4P, there is limited evidence on how providers achieve performance gains and how P4P affects health system quality by changing structural inputs. We explore these two questions in the context of Rwanda's 2006 national P4P programme by examining the programme's impact on structural quality measures drawn from international and national guidelines. Given the programme's previously documented success at increasing institutional delivery rates, we focus on a set of delivery-specific and more general structural inputs. Using the programme's quasi-randomized rollout, we apply multivariate regression analysis to short-run facility data from the 2007 Service Provision Assessment. We find positive programme effects on the presence of maternity-related staff, the presence of covered waiting areas and a management indicator and a negative programme effect on delivery statistics monitoring. We find no effects on a set of other delivery-specific physical resources, delivery-specific human resources, delivery-specific operations, general physical resources and general human resources. Usingmediation analysis, we find that the positive input differences explain a small and insignificant fraction of P4P's impact on institutional delivery rates. The results suggest that P4P increases provider availability and facility operations but is only weakly linked with short-run structural health system improvements overall.},

              Introduction
              Health facility preparedness is essential for delivering quality maternal and newborn care, minimizing morbidity and mortality by addressing delays in seeking skilled care, reaching appropriate facilities, and receiving emergency care. A rapid assessment of 23 government health facilities in Kilifi and Kisii counties identified poor maternal and newborn indicators in 16 facilities. The Access to Quality Care through Extending and Strengthening Health Systems ({AQCESS}) project supported these facilities with training, equipment, and referral linkages. This study focuses on facility preparedness of the 16 facilities to deliver maternal and newborn health services, specifically delays two and three at the end of the project implementation.
            
            
              Methods
              A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried-out on behalf of {AQCESS} project team by respective county ministry of health in-charge of reproductive maternal newborn and child health programs and trained nurses and medical doctors from Aga Khan health services in December 2019. The study evaluated the accessibility and reliability of drugs, commodities, equipment, personnel, basic necessities (such as water and electricity), and guidelines using validated World Health Organization service availability and readiness assessment tool. The findings of the assessment are presented through frequency and percentage analysis, along with a comparative analysis between the two counties.
            
            
              Results
              All the 16 facilities assessed offered routine antenatal care ({ANC}) and normal delivery, but only two provided comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care ({CEmONC}). Most essential medicines, commodities, and required equipment were available. {BEmONC} and {CEmONC} guidelines were present in Kilifi, not in Kisii. One staff member was available 24/7 for cesarean section ({CS}) in each county, with one anesthetist in Kilifi. Electricity was accessible in all facilities, but only half had secondary power supply. Facilities offering {CS} had backup generators.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The Facilities assessed had necessary drugs, commodities, equipment, and requirements, but staffing and guidelines were limited. Kilifi outperformed Kisii in most indicators. Additional support is needed for infrastructure and human resources to deliver quality maternal and newborn health services. Continuous monitoring will facilitate resource allocation based on facility needs.},

              Background
              The neonatal mortality rate in Uganda has barely changed over the past decades, estimated at 28/1000 and 27/1000 live births in 2006 and 2016 respectively. The survivors have a higher risk of developing neurodevelopmental disabilities ({NDD}) due to brain insults from perinatal complications related to poor quality of health services during pregnancy, around the time of birth, and during the postnatal period. This study aimed to assess health facility readiness to care for high risk newborn babies in order to inform programming that fosters early childhood development in eastern Uganda.
            
            
              Methods
              A cross sectional study of 6 hospitals and 10 higher level health centers that offer comprehensive maternal and newborn care was carried out in February 2020 in eastern Uganda. A World Health Organization Service Availability and Readiness Assessment tool ({SARA}) was adapted and used to assess the health facility readiness to manage maternal and neonatal conditions that are related to {NDD}. In addition, 201 mothers of high risk newborn babies were interviewed on their satisfaction with health services received. Readiness scores were derived from percentage average facilities with available infrastructure and essential medical commodities to manage neonatal complications. Descriptive statistics were computed for client satisfaction with service provision, and p values used to compare private not for profit to public health facilities.
            
            
              Results
              
                There was limited availability in numbers and skilled human resource especially the neonatal nurses. Hospitals and health centers scored least in preterm and hypothermia care, with averages of 38\% and 18\% respectively. The highest scores were in essential newborn care, with readiness of 78\% and 85\% for hospitals and health centers, followed by resuscitation at 78\% and 77\%, respectively. There were no guidelines on positive interaction with newborn babies to foster neurodevelopment. The main cause of admission to neonatal care units was birth asphyxia followed by prematurity, indicative of intrapartum care challenges. The overall client satisfaction with health services was higher in private not for profit facilities at 91\% compared to public hospitals at 73\%,
                p
                 = 0.017.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Health facility readiness was inadequate in management of preterm complications. Efforts should, therefore, be geared to improving availability of inputs and quality of emergency obstetric and newborn care in order to manage high risk newborns and reduce the burden of {NDD} in this setting.},

            Improving the quality of care is increasingly recognized as a priority of health systems in low- and middle-income countries.

Policies available to boost the performance of health workers—and thus the quality of healthcare—include regulation, incentives and supervision—all of which are typically included in quality improvement frameworks and policies. This was the case in Tanzania, where we assessed the role of selected quality improvement policies. To do so, we analysed data from a representative sample of Tanzanian government-managed health facilities, part of the 2014/15 Service Provision Assessment component of the Demographic and Health Survey. We constructed two healthcare quality indicators from data on patient visits: (1) compliance with Integrated Management of Childhood Illness ({IMCI}) guidelines and (2) patient satisfaction. Using multilevel ordered logistic regression models, we estimated the associations between the outcomes and selected indicators of incentives and supervisory activity at health worker and health facility level. We did not identify any association for the different indicators of top-down supervision at facility and individual level, neither with {IMCI} compliance nor with patients’ satisfaction. Bottom-up supervision, defined as meetings between community and health facility staff, was significantly associated with higher patient satisfaction. Financial incentives in the form of salary top-ups were positively associated with both {IMCI} compliance and patient satisfaction. Both housing allowances and government-subsidized housing were positively associated with our proxies of quality of care. Good healthcare quality is crucial for promoting health in Tanzania not only through direct outcomes of the process of care but also through increased care-seeking behaviour in the communities. The results of this study highlight the role of community involvement, better salary conditions and housing arrangements for health workers.},

	abstract = {Access to healthcare is a requirement for human well-being that is constrained, in part, by the allocation of healthcare resources relative to the geographically dispersed human population1–3. Quantifying access to care globally is challenging due to the absence of a comprehensive database of healthcare facilities. We harness major data collection efforts underway by {OpenStreetMap}, Google Maps and academic researchers to compile the most complete collection of facility locations to date. Leveraging the geographically variable strengths of our facility datasets, we use an established methodology4 to characterize travel time to healthcare facilities in unprecedented detail. We produce maps of travel time with and without access to motorized transport, thus characterizing travel time to healthcare for populations distributed across the wealth spectrum. We find that just 8.9\% of the global population (646 million people) cannot reach healthcare within one hour if they have access to motorized transport, and that 43.3\% (3.16 billion people) cannot reach a healthcare facility by foot within one hour. Our maps highlight an additional vulnerability faced by poorer individuals in remote areas and can help to estimate whether individuals will seek healthcare when it is needed, as well as providing an evidence base for efficiently distributing limited healthcare and transportation resources to underserved populations both now and in the future.},

	abstract = {Objectives
              To determine the availability and readiness of health facilities to provide family planning, antenatal care and basic emergency obstetric and newborn care in Nepal in 2021. Secondary objectives were to identify progress since 2015 and factors associated with readiness.
            
            
              Method
              This is a secondary analysis of cross-sectional Nepal Health Facility Survey ({NHFS}) data collected in 2015 and 2021. The main outcome measures were availability and readiness of family planning, antenatal care, and basic emergency obstetric and newborn care services. Readiness indices were calculated using {WHO}-recommended service availability and readiness assessment ({SARA}) methods (score range 0 to 100\%, with 100\% indicating facilities are fully prepared to provide a specific service). We used independent t-tests to compare readiness indices in 2015 and 2021. Factors potentially associated with readiness (rurality setting, ecological region, managing authority, management meeting, quality assurance activities, and external supervision) were explored using multivariable linear regression.
            
            
              Results
              There were 940 and 1565 eligible health facilities in the 2015 and 2021 surveys, respectively. Nearly all health facilities provided family planning (2015: n = 919 (97.8\%); 2021: n = 1530 (97.8\%)) and antenatal care services (2015: n = 920 (97.8\%); 2021: n = 1538 (98.3\%)) in both years, but only half provided delivery services (2015: n = 457 (48.6\%); 2021: n = 804 (51.4\%)). There were suboptimal improvements in readiness indices over time: (2015–21: family planning 68.0\% to 70.9\%, p{\textless}0.001, antenatal care 49.5\% to 54.1\%, p{\textless}0.001 and basic emergency obstetric and newborn care 56.7\% to 58.0\%, p = 0.115). The regression model comprising combined datasets of both {NHFSs} indicates facilities with regular management meetings and/or quality assurance activities had significantly greater readiness for all three indices. Similarly, public facilities had greater readiness for family planning and basic emergency obstetric and newborn care while they had lower readiness for antenatal care.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Readiness to deliver family planning, antenatal care and basic emergency obstetric and newborn care services in Nepal remains inadequate, with little improvement observed over six years.},

	abstract = {Objective The health system context influences the implementation of evidence-based practices and quality of healthcare services. Ethiopia aims at reaching universal health coverage but faces low primary care utilisation and substandard quality of care. We assessed the health extension workers' perceived context and the preparedness of health posts to provide services. Setting This study was part of evaluating a complex intervention in 52 districts of four regions of Ethiopia. This paper used the endline data collected from December 2018 to February 2019. Participants A total of 152 health posts and health extension workers serving selected enumeration areas were included. Outcome measures We used the Context Assessment for Community Health ({COACH}) tool and the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment tool. Results Internal reliability of {COACH} was satisfactory. The dimensions community engagement, work culture, commitment to work and leadership all scored high (mean 3.75-4.01 on a 1-5 scale), while organisational resources, sources of knowledge and informal payments scored low (1.78-2.71). The general service readiness index was 59\%. On average, 67\% of the health posts had basic amenities to provide services, 81\% had basic equipment, 42\% had standard precautions for infection prevention, 47\% had test capacity for malaria and 58\% had essential medicines. Conclusion The health extension workers had a good relationship with the local community, used data for planning, were highly committed to their work with positive perceptions of their work culture, a relatively positive attitude regarding their leaders, and reported no corruption or informal payments. In contrast, they had insufficient sources of information and a severe lack of resources. The health post preparedness confirmed the low level of resources and preparedness for services. These findings suggest a significant potential contribution by health extension workers to Ethiopia's primary healthcare, provided that they receive improved support, including new information and essential resources.},

	abstract = {One of the major contributors of malaria-related deaths in Sub-Saharan African countries is the limited accessibility to quality care. In these countries, malaria control activities are implemented at the health-district level (operational entity of the national health system), while malaria readiness indicators are regionally representative. This study provides an approach for estimating health district-level malaria readiness indicators from survey data designed to provide regionally representative estimates. A binomial-hierarchical Bayesian spatial prediction method was applied to Burkina Faso Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) survey data to provide estimates of essential equipment availability and readiness for malaria care. Predicted values of each indicator were adjusted by the type of health facility, location, and population density. Then, a health district composite readiness profile was built via hierarchical ascendant classification. All surveyed health-facilities were mandated by the Ministry of Health to manage malaria cases. The spatial distribution of essential equipment and malaria readiness was heterogeneous. Around 62.9\% of health districts had a high level of readiness to provide malaria care and prevention during pregnancy. Low-performance scores for managing malaria cases were found in big cities. Health districts with low coverage for both first-line antimalarial drugs and rapid diagnostic tests were Baskuy, Bogodogo, Boulmiougou, Nongr-Massoum, Sig-Nonghin, Dafra, and Do. We provide health district estimates and reveal gaps in basic equipment and malaria management resources in some districts that need to be filled. By providing local-scale estimates, this approach could be replicated for other types of indicators to inform decision makers and health program managers and to identify priority areas.},

	abstract = {Background
Low-income and middle-income countries ({LMICs}) face a double burden of malnutrition ({DBM}), whereby overnutrition and undernutrition coexist within the same individual, household, or population. This analysis investigates global inequalities in household-level {DBM}, expressed as a stunted child with an overweight mother, and its association with economic, social, and political globalisation across country income and household wealth.
Methods
We pooled anthropometric and demographic data for 1 132 069 children (aged {\textless}5 years) and their mothers (aged 15–49 years) from 189 Demographic and Health Surveys in 55 {LMICs} between 1992 and 2018. These data were combined with country-level data on economic, social, and political globalisation from the Konjunkturforschungsstelle Globalisation Index and gross national income ({GNI}) from the World Bank. Multivariate associations between {DBM} and household wealth, {GNI}, and globalisation and their interactions were tested using multilevel logistic regression models with country and year fixed-effects and robust standard errors clustered by country.
Findings
The probability of {DBM} was higher among richer households in poorer {LMICs} and poorer households in richer {LMICs}. Economic globalisation was associated with higher odds of {DBM} among the poorest households (odds ratio 1·49, 95\% {CI} 1·20–1·86) compared with the richest households. These associations attenuated as {GNI} increased. Social globalisation was associated with higher odds of {DBM} (1·39, 95\% {CI} 1·16–1·65), independently of household wealth or country income. No associations were identified between political globalisation and {DBM}.
Interpretation
Increases in economic and social globalisation were associated with higher {DBM}, although the impacts of economic globalisation were mostly realised by the world's poorest. The economic patterning of {DBM} observed in this study calls for subpopulation-specific double-duty actions, which should further aim to mitigate the potential negative and unequal impacts of globalisation.

	abstract = {Background Malaria burden in Uganda has declined disproportionately among regions despite overall high intervention coverage across all regions. The Uganda Malaria Indicator Survey ({MIS}) 2014–15 was the second nationally representative survey conducted to provide estimates of malaria prevalence among children less than 5 years, and to track the progress of control interventions in the country. In this present study, 2014–15 {MIS} data were analysed to assess intervention effects on malaria prevalence in Uganda among children less than 5 years, assess intervention effects at regional level, and estimate geographical distribution of malaria prevalence in the country. Methods Bayesian geostatistical models with spatially varying coefficients were used to determine the effect of interventions on malaria prevalence at national and regional levels. Spike-and-slab variable selection was used to identify the most important predictors and forms. Bayesian kriging was used to predict malaria prevalence at unsampled locations. Results Indoor Residual Spraying ({IRS}) and Insecticide Treated Nets ({ITN}) ownership had a significant but varying protective effect on malaria prevalence. However, no effect was observed for Artemisinin Combination-based Therapies ({ACTs}). Environmental factors, namely, land cover, rainfall, day and night land surface temperature, and area type were significantly associated with malaria prevalence. Malaria prevalence was higher in rural areas, increased with the child’s age, and decreased with higher household socioeconomic status and higher level of mother’s education. The highest prevalence of malaria in children less than 5 years was predicted for regions of East Central, North East and West Nile, whereas the lowest was predicted in Kampala and South Western regions, and in the mountainous areas in Mid-Western and Mid-Eastern regions. Conclusions {IRS} and {ITN} ownership are important interventions against malaria prevalence in children less than 5 years in Uganda. The varying effects of the interventions calls for selective implementation of control tools suitable to regional ecological settings. To further reduce malaria burden and sustain malaria control in Uganda, current tools should be supplemented by health system strengthening, and socio-economic development.},

Main outcome measure Health facility birth. Results A one-unit increase in the mean score of the readiness of health facilities to provide basic emergency obstetric care ({EmOC}) was associated with a two-fold increase in the odds of facility birthing (adjusted odds ratio, {aOR}, 2.094, 95\% {CI} 1.187–3.694). A woman’s attendance for at least four antenatal care visits was significantly associated with facility birth ({aOR} 8.863, 95\% {CI} 6.748–11.640). Distance to a healthcare facility was inversely related to a woman’s use of facility birthing ({aOR} 0.967, 95\% {CI} 0.944–0.991).

In this study, the {PHC} system was assessed to understand factors influencing the uptake of the {NEPHSP} for hypertension and T2DM management.Methods A mixed-methods study was conducted in seven counties/districts from five provinces across the mainland of China. Data included a {PHC} facility level survey and interviews with policy makers, health administrators, {PHC} providers, and individuals with hypertension and/or T2DM. The facility survey used the World Health Organisation ({WHO}) service availability and readiness assessment questionnaire. Interviews were thematically analysed using the {WHO} health systems building blocks.Findings A total of 518 facility surveys were collected with over 90\% in rural settings (n = 474). Forty-eight in-depth individual interviews and 19 focus-group discussions were conducted across all sites. Triangulating the quantitative and qualitative data found that China's continuous political commitment to strengthening the {PHC} system led to improvements in workforce and infrastructure. Despite this, many barriers were identified, including insufficient and under-qualified {PHC} personnel, remaining gaps in medicines and equipment, fragmented health information systems, residents' low trust and utilization of {PHC}, challenges in coordinated and continuous care, and lack of cross-sectorial collaborations. Interpretation The study findings provided recommendation for future {PHC} system strengthening, including improving the quality of {NEPHSP} delivery, facilitating resource-sharing across health facilities, establishing integrated care systems, and exploring mechanisms for better cross-sectorial engagement in health governance.Funding The study is supported by National Health and Medical Research Council ({NHMRC}) Global Alliance for Chronic Disease funding ({APP}1169757).Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s).

              Background
              When Service Provision Assessment ({SPA}) surveys on primary health service delivery are combined with the nationally representative household survey—Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}), they can provide key information on the access, utilization, and equity of health service availability in low- and middle-income countries. However, existing linkage methods have been established only at aggregate levels due to known limitations of the survey datasets.
            
            
              Methods
              For the linkage of two data sets at a disaggregated level, we developed a geostatistical approach where {SPA} limitations are explicitly accounted for by identifying the sites where health facilities might be present but not included in {SPA} surveys. Using the knowledge gained from {SPA} surveys related to the contextual information around facilities and their spatial structure, we made an inference on the service environment of unsampled health facilities. The geostatistical linkage results on the availability of health service were validated using two criteria—prediction accuracy and classification error. We also assessed the effect of displacement of {DHS} clusters on the linkage results using simulation.
            
            
              Results
              The performance evaluation of the geostatistical linkage method, demonstrated using information on the general service readiness of sampled health facilities in Tanzania, showed that the proposed methods exceeded the performance of the existing methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and classification error. We also found that the geostatistical linkage methods are more robust than existing methods with respect to the displacement of {DHS} clusters.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The proposed geospatial approach minimizes the methodological issues and has potential to be used in various public health research applications where facility and population-based data need to be combined at fine spatial scale.},

              Background
              Early initiation of breastfeeding (within an hour of birth) has benefits for newborn health and survival. Optimal breastfeeding supports growth, health, and development. Health facilities provide essential pregnancy, maternal, and newborn care and offer support for early breastfeeding. We examined the relationship between the breastfeeding-related health service environment during antenatal care ({ANC}) and early initiation of breastfeeding.
            
            
              Methods
              Using data from recent Service Provision Assessment ({SPA}) surveys in Haiti and Malawi, we defined three indicators of the health service environment: availability of facilities with {ANC} services reporting routine breastfeeding counseling; provider training on breastfeeding; and breastfeeding counseling during {ANC}. We linked {SPA} data geographically to Demographic and Health Surveys ({DHS}) data from Haiti and Malawi. Multilevel, multivariable logistic regressions examined associations between the health service environment and early initiation of breastfeeding, controlling for women’s background characteristics, with separate analyses for urban and rural residence.
            
            
              Results
              Over 95\% of facilities in Haiti and Malawi reported routinely providing breastfeeding counseling during {ANC}. Only 40\% of both urban and rural providers in Malawi and 29 and 26\% of providers at urban and rural facilities in Haiti (respectively) received recent training in counseling on breastfeeding. Further, only 4–10\% of clients received counseling. Breastfeeding counseling was generally more common among clients who attended {ANC} with a provider who had received recent training. After linking {SPA} and {DHS} data, our analysis showed that having more providers recently trained on breastfeeding was significantly associated with increased odds of early breastfeeding among women in urban areas of Haiti and Malawi. Additionally, women in urban areas of Malawi lived near facilities with more counseling during {ANC} were more likely to begin breastfeeding within an hour of birth compared with women in areas with less counseling.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our study identified gaps in the health system’s capacity to implement the recommended global guidelines in support of optimal breastfeeding practices. While breastfeeding counseling during {ANC} can promote early breastfeeding, counseling was not common. The study provides evidence that provider training could help improve counseling and support for early initiation of breastfeeding.},

	abstract = {Background: Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy ({IPTp}) delivered during antenatal care ({ANC}) visits has been shown to be a highly efficacious and cost-effective intervention. Given the high rates of {ANC} attendance in sub-Saharan Africa, the current low {IPTp} coverage represents considerable missed opportunities. The objective of this study was to explore factors affecting provider's delivery of {IPTp} during {ANC} consultations. Methods: Data from five nationally representative service provision assessment surveys informed the statistical analyses (Kenya, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda; 2006-2010). Poisson regression models with robust/clustered standard errors were used to estimate the effect of different determinants on {IPTp} delivery from 4,971 observed {ANC} consultations. Results: The five major modifiable determinants of {IPTp} delivery were: 1) user-fees for {ANC} medicines (relative risk ({RR}) = 0.76; 95\% confidence intervals (95\% {CI}): 0.62-0.93); 2) facilities having {IPTp} guidelines ({RR} = 1.12; 95\% {CI}: 1.01-1.24); 3) facilities having implemented {IPTp} as part of their routine {ANC} services offering ({RR} = 4.18; 95\% {CI}: 1.75-10.01); 4) stock-outs of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ({RR} = 0.40; 95\% {CI}: 0.27-0.60); and, 5) providers having received {IPTp} training ({RR} = 1.21; 95\% {CI}: 1.09-1.35). Using the population-attributable fraction, it was estimated that addressing these barriers jointly could lead to a 31\% increase in delivery of this intervention during {ANC} consultations. Of these four potentially modifiable determinants, training of providers for {IPTp} had the largest potential impact. Conclusions: If proved to be cost-effective, dispensing {IPTp} training to {ANC} providers should be prioritized. Multifaceted approaches targeted in areas of low coverage and/or type of facilities least likely to provide this intervention should be implemented if the Roll Back Malaria target of 100\% {IPTp} coverage by 2015 is to be attained.},

	abstract = {Objective Increasing the availability of basic healthcare services in low-and middle-income countries is not sufficient to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target for child survival in high-mortality settings, where healthcare utilisation is often inconsistent and quality of care can be poor. We assessed whether poor quality of sick child healthcare in Malawi is associated with low utilisation of sick child healthcare.
Design We measured two elements of quality of sick child healthcare: facility structural readiness and process of care using data from the 2013 Malawi Service Provision Assessment. Overall quality was defined as the average of these metrics. We extracted demographic data from the 2013–2014 Malawi Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey and linked households to nearby facilities using geocodes. We used logistic regression to examine the association of facility quality with utilisation of formal health services for children under 5 years of age suffering diarrhoea, fever or cough/acute respiratory illness, controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. We conducted sensitivity analyses ({SAs}), modifying the travel distance and population—facility matching criteria.
Setting and population 568 facilities were linked with 9701 children with recent illness symptoms in Malawi, of whom 69\% had been brought to a health facility.
Results Overall, facilities showed gaps in structural quality (62\% readiness) and major deficiencies in process quality (33\%), for an overall quality score of 48\%. Better facility quality was associated with higher odds of utilisation of sick child healthcare services (adjusted {ORs} ({AOR}): 1.66, 95\% {CI}: 1.04 to 2.63), as was structural quality alone ({AOR}: 1.33, 95\% {CI}: 0.95 to 1.87). {SAs} supported the main finding.
Conclusion Although Malawi’s health facilities for curative child care are widely available, quality and utilisation of sick child healthcare services are in short supply. Improving facility quality may provide a way to encourage higher utilisation of healthcare, thereby decreasing preventable childhood morbidity and mortality.},

This study identified the geographical hot spots of {SBI} in Bangladesh and the factors associated with them. We analyzed women's data extracted from the 2017/18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey and the healthcare facility data extracted from the 2017 Service Provision Assessment. {SBI} was the outcome variable, and it was defined as an interval between consecutive births of 33 months or less, as recommended by the World Health Organization. The characteristics of mothers and their partners were the explanatory variables. Moran's I was used to examine the spatial variation of {SBI} in Bangladesh whereas the Getis-Ord G(i)*(d) was used to determine the hot spots of {SBI}. The Geographical Weighted Regression ({GWR}) was used to assess the predictors of {SBI} at the enumeration areas' level. The variables included in the {GWR} were selected using the exploratory regression and ordinary least square regression model. Data of 5941 women were included in the analyses. Around 26\% of the total births in Bangladesh had occurred in short intervals. A majority of the {SBI} hot spots were found in the Sylhet division, and almost all {SBI} cold spots were in the Rajshahi and Khulna divisions. No engagement with formal income-generating activities, high maternal parity, and history of experiencing the death of a child were significantly associated with {SBI} in the Sylhet division. Women's age of 34 years or less at the first birth was a protective factor of {SBI} in the Rajshahi and Khulna divisions. The prevalence of {SBI} in Bangladesh is highly clustered in the Sylhet division. We recommend introducing tailored reproductive health care services in the hot spots instead of the existing uniform approach across the country.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Rehabilitation services aim to optimise individuals’ functioning and reduce disability. However, people with disabilities, who represent a key population of users of rehabilitation services, continue to have unmet needs for rehabilitation services that include the provision of assistive devices. This paper examines the availability and accessibility of rehabilitation services in a rural district of South Africa in order to explore why unmet needs for rehabilitation services persist. Methods: All nine district hospitals in a rural district of South Africa were included in the study. Rehabilitation services capacity was assessed by examining the available assistive devices, consumables and human resources at the level of the health facility. Data collection was conducted using the Global Co-operative Assistive Technology [{GATE}] Assistive Products List, {AT}2030’s {ATScale} priority list and the South African National Catalogue of Commodities for Primary Health Care Facilities. Descriptive statistics were then used for the analysis. For the qualitative component, semi-structured interviews were conducted with adults with physical disabilities at household level to explore barriers to accessing assistive device inclusive rehabilitation services and the consequences thereof in the same rural district. An interview guide based on the {WHO} health system building blocks was used. Thematic content analysis guided the analysis of the interview transcripts. Findings: The findings of the research demonstrate that rehabilitation service capacity in the district was constrained as a result of low availability of assistive devices [2–22\%] and consumables [2–47\%], as well as, possibly, a shortage of rehabilitation providers [n = 30] with an unequal distribution across health facilities [n = 9]. In addition, people with physical disabilities reported poor referral pathways, financial constraints, transport and road consideration and equipment unavailability as barriers to accessing rehabilitation services. Moreover, these barriers to access predisposed individuals to finance-, health- and person-related harm. Conclusion: Rehabilitation service availability is constrained by a lack of service capacity in rural South Africa. In addition, the rehabilitation services in district hospitals are not adequately accessible because of existing barriers to enable key populations to achieve optimised functioning.},

	abstract = {{BackgroundEnsuring} universal access to malaria diagnosis and treatment is a key component of Pillar 1 of the World Health Organization Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030. To achieve this goal it is essential to know the types of facilities where the population seeks care as well as the malaria service readiness of these facilities in endemic countries.{MethodsTo} investigate the utilization and provision of malaria services, data on the sources of advice or treatment in children under 5years with fever from the household-based Demographic and Health Surveys ({DHS}) and on the components of malaria service readiness from the facility-based Service Provision Assessment ({SPA}) surveys were examined in Malawi, Senegal and Tanzania. Facilities categorized as malaria-service ready were those with: (1) personnel trained in either malaria rapid diagnostic testing ({RDT}), microscopy or case management/treatment of malaria in children; (2) national guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of malaria; (3) diagnostic capacity (available {RDT} tests or microscopy equipment as well as staff trained in its use); and, (4) unexpired artemisinin-based combination therapy ({ACT}) available on the day of the survey.{ResultsIn} all three countries primary-level facilities (health centre/health post/health clinic) were the type of facility most used for care of febrile children. However, only 69\% of these facilities in Senegal, 32\% in Malawi and 19\% in Tanzania were classified as malaria-service ready. Of the four components of malaria-service readiness in the facilities most frequented by febrile children, diagnostic capacity was the weakest area in all three countries, followed by trained personnel. All three countries performed well in the availability of {ACT}.{ConclusionsThis} analysis highlights the need to improve the malaria-service readiness of facilities in all three countries. More effort should be focused on facilities that are commonly used for care of fever, especially in the areas of malaria diagnostic capacity and provider training. It is essential for policymakers to consider the malaria-service readiness of primary healthcare facilities when allocating resources. This is particularly important in limited-resource settings to ensure that the facilities most visited for care are properly equipped to provide diagnosis and treatment for malaria.},

	abstract = {Background
Reductions in neonatal mortality remain stagnant, despite gains in health care access and utilization. Nutrition interventions during antenatal care ({ANC}) and in the immediate postpartum period are associated with improved neonatal outcomes. Adjusting coverage estimates for the quality of care provided yields greater insight into health system performance and potential population health benefits of accessing care. In this cross-sectional study, we adjust maternity care coverage measures for quality of nutrition interventions to determine the impact on infant birth weight and breastfeeding.

Methods
We used household data from the Malawi 2013-2014 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey to assess use of maternal health services and direct observations of {ANC} and delivery from the 2013 Service Provision Assessment to measure nutrition interventions provided. We adjusted coverage measures combining self-reported utilization of care with the likelihood of receipt of nutrition interventions. Using adjusted log-linear regression, we estimated the associations of these nutrition quality-adjusted metrics with infant birthweight and immediate breastfeeding.

Results
Health facility data provided over 2500 directly observed clinical encounters and household data provided 7385 individual reports of health care utilization and outcomes. Utilization of {ANC} and facility-delivery was high. Women received nutrition-related interventions considerably less often than they sought care: over the course of {ANC} women received a median of 1.6 interventions on iron, 1 instance of nutrition counseling, and 0.06 instances of breastfeeding counseling. Nutrition quality-adjusted {ANC} coverage was associated with a reduced risk of low birthweight (adjusted relative risk [{ARR}] 0.87, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) = 0.79, 0.96) and increased likelihood of immediate breastfeeding ({ARR} = 1.04, 95\% {CI} = 1.02, 1.07); nutrition quality-adjusted post-delivery care was also associated with greater uptake of immediate breastfeeding ({ARR} = 1.08, 95\% {CI} = 1.02, 1.14). Based on these models, delivering nutrition interventions consistently within the existing level of coverage would decrease population prevalence of low birthweight from 13.7\% to 10.8\% and increase population prevalence of immediate breastfeeding from 75.9\% to 86.0\%.

Conclusions
Linking household survey data to health service provision assessments demonstrates that despite high utilization of maternal health services in Malawi, low provision of nutrition interventions is undermining infant health. Substantial gains in newborn health are possible in Malawi if quality of existing services is strengthened.},

	abstract = {Background
Despite large investments in the public health care system, disparities in health outcomes persist between lower- and upper-income individuals, as well as rural vs urban dwellers in Ethiopia. Evidence from Ethiopia and other low- and middle-income countries suggests that challenges in health care access may contribute to poverty in these settings.

Methods
We employed a two-step floating catchment area to estimate variations in spatial access to health care and in staffing levels at health care facilities. We estimated the average travel time from the population centers of administrative areas and adjusted them with provider-to-population ratios. To test hypotheses about the role of travel time vs staffing, we applied Spearman’s rank tests to these two variables against the access score to assess the significance of observed variations.

Results
Among Ethiopia’s 11 first-level administrative units, Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, and Harari had the best access scores. Regions with the lowest access scores were generally poorer and more rural/pastoral. Approximately 18\% of the country did not have access to a public health care facility within a two-hour walk. Our results suggest that spatial access and staffing issues both contribute to access challenges.

Conclusion
Investments both in new health facilities and staffing in existing facilities will be necessary to improve health care access within Ethiopia. Because rural and low-income areas are more likely to have poor access, future strategies for expanding and strengthening the health care system should strongly emphasize equity and the role of improved access in reducing poverty.},

We adjusted contact-based coverage estimates, taking into consideration the inputs required to deliver quality nutrition services, to calculate input-adjusted coverage of nutrition interventions across the continuum of care from pregnancy through early childhood in Bangladesh. Methods We used data from the 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys to assess use of maternal and child health services and the 2014 Service Provision Assessment to determine facility readiness to deliver nutrition interventions. Service readiness captured availability of nutrition-specific inputs (including human resources and training, equipment, diagnostics and medicines). Contact coverage was combined with service readiness to create a measure of input-adjusted coverage at the national and regional levels, across place of residence, and by maternal education and household socioeconomic quintiles. Results Contact coverage varied from 28\% for attending at least four {ANC} visits to 38\% for institutional delivery, 35\% for child growth monitoring and 81\% for sick child care. Facilities demonstrated incomplete readiness for nutrition interventions, ranging from 48\% to 51\% across services. Nutrition input-adjusted coverage was suboptimal (18\% for {ANC}, 23\% for institutional delivery, 20\% for child growth monitoring and 52\% for sick child care) and varied between regions within the country. Inequalities in input-adjusted coverage were large during {ANC} and institutional delivery (14-17 percentage points (pp) between urban and rural areas, 15 pp between low and high education, and 28-34 pp between highest and lowest wealth quintiles) and less variable for sick child care (¡2 pp). Conclusion Nutrition input-adjusted coverage was suboptimal and varied subnationally and across the continuum of care in Bangladesh.

	abstract = {Background
              Pneumonia remains the leading cause of child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness ({IMCI}) strategy was developed to standardise care in low-income and middle-income countries for major childhood illnesses and can effectively improve healthcare worker performance. Suboptimal clinical evaluation can result in missed diagnoses and excess morbidity and mortality. We estimate the sensitivity of pneumonia diagnosis and investigate its determinants among children in Malawi.
            
            
              Methods
              Data were obtained from the 2013–2014 Service Provision Assessment survey, a census of health facilities in Malawi that included direct observation of care and re-examination of children by trained observers. We calculated sensitivity of pneumonia diagnosis and used multilevel log-binomial regression to assess factors associated with diagnostic sensitivity.
            
            
              Results
              3136 clinical visits for children 2–59 months old were observed at 742 health facilities. Healthcare workers completed an average of 30\% ({SD} 13\%) of {IMCI} guidelines in each encounter. 573 children met the {IMCI} criteria for pneumonia; 118 (21\%) were correctly diagnosed. Advanced practice clinicians were more likely than other providers to diagnose pneumonia correctly (adjusted relative risk 2.00, 95\% {CI} 1.21 to 3.29). Clinical quality was strongly associated with correct diagnosis: sensitivity was 23\% in providers at the 75th percentile for guideline adherence compared with 14\% for those at the 25th percentile. Contextual factors, facility structural readiness, and training or supervision were not associated with sensitivity.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Care quality for Malawian children is poor, with low guideline adherence and missed diagnosis for four of five children with pneumonia. Better sensitivity is associated with provider type and higher adherence to {IMCI}. Existing interventions such as training and supportive supervision are associated with higher guideline adherence, but are insufficient to meaningfully improve sensitivity. Innovative and scalable quality improvement interventions are needed to strengthen health systems and reduce avoidable child mortality.},

Demographic context is one of the most cited predictors of identity strength, but the size and direction of its effects are disputed. Geographic differences in policy environments may explain the phenomenon. We argue that high levels of immigration enforcement indirectly lead to increased feelings of ethnic linked fate by determining where and how demographic context—in this case, the size of the immigrant population—will be salient. To test this, we combine information from local immigration-enforcement data (obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests) with the Latino Decisions' 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey. The results suggest native-born Latinos have a stronger sense of ethnic linked fate when they live near large immigrant populations and rates of enforcement are high. When enforcement is low, the presence of immigrants has a negligible effect on native-born attitudes. Foreign-born Latinos' sense of linked fate is unaffected by policy context. These results suggest that as immigration enforcement becomes intensifies, conservative politicians may see increased backlash, at least in certain communities, from native-born Latinos. This is because feelings about ethnic linked fate correlate with increased participation and more proimmigrant policy stances.},

	abstract = {Research has shown that interviewers can significantly affect survey respondents’ reported attitudes and behaviors. Several interviewer characteristics have been found to partially explain variation in respondents’ answers across interviewers, particularly when questions are related to interviewers’ observable characteristics such as gender, race, and age. However, less is known about if and how interviewers’ religious appearance and religious attitudes affect survey responses and, more specifically, reports about religious attitudes. Collecting accurate information on religious attitudes is important, given the sensitivity of this information across the globe and the growing interest in understanding religious perceptions and misconceptions. This paper is the first to investigate (a) the independent effects and the interplay between interviewers’ religious veil status and interviewers’ religious attitudes on respondents’ reported religious attitudes and (b) the magnitude of the interviewer variance explained by interviewers’ religious characteristics. The data comes from a nationally representative survey of religious and political attitudes in Tunisia carried out in 2013. Data from the survey also includes information about interviewers’ characteristics (including veil status for females) and interviewers’ own religious attitudes based on their responses to the same survey questions asked of respondents. Results showed that respondents interviewed by veiled female interviewers reported greater religiosity than respondents interviewed by unveiled female interviewers. Equally important were interviewers’ religious attitudes, which also independently affected the corresponding attitudes of respondents and explained a substantial percentage of the between-interviewer variance for several outcomes. The effect of interviewers’ attitudes on respondents’ attitudes was not stronger among veiled interviewers. Our investigation also revealed that the effect of interviewers’ attitudes on respondents’ reported attitudes operated somewhat differently for male and female respondents depending on the specific survey items. Future studies are needed to explore the mechanism(s) underlying these effects.},

              Background
              Infrastructure development and upgrading to support safe surgical services in primary health care facilities is an important step in the journey towards achieving Universal Health Coverage ({UHC}). Quality health service provision together with equitable geographic access and service delivery are important components that constitute {UHC}. Tanzania has been investing in infrastructure development to offer essential safe surgery close to communities at affordable costs while ensuring better outcomes. This study aimed to understand the public sector’s efforts to improve the infrastructure of primary health facilities between 2005 and 2019. We assessed the construction rates, geographic coverage, and physical status of each facility, surgical safety and services rendered in public primary health facilities.
            
            
              Methods
              Data was collected from existing policy reports, the Services Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) tool (physical status), the Health Facility Registry ({HFR}), implementation reports on infrastructure development from the 26 regions and 185 district councils across the country (covering assessment of physical infrastructure, waste management systems and inventories for ambulances) and Comprehensive Emergence Obstetric Care ({CEMONC}) signal functions assessment tool. Data was descriptively analyzed so as to understand the distribution of primary health care facilities and their status (old, new, upgraded, under construction, renovated and equipped), and the service provided, including essential surgical services.
            
            
              Results
              Of 5072 (518 are Health Centers and 4554 are Dispensaries) existing public primary health care facilities, the majority (46\%) had a physical status of A (good state), 33\% (1693) had physical status of B (minor renovation needed) and the remaining facilities had physical status of C up to F (needing major renovation). About 33\% (1673) of all health facilities had piped water and 5.1\% had landline telecommunication system. Between 2015 and August 2019, a total of 419 (8.3\%) health facilities (Consisting of 350 health centers and 69 District Council Hospitals) were either renovated or constructed and equipped to offer safe surgery services. Of all Health Centers only 115 (22.2\%) were offering the {CEMONC} services. Of these 115 health facilities, only 20 (17.4\%) were offering the {CEMONC} services with all 9 - signal functions and only 17.4\% had facilities that are offering safe blood transfusion services.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This study indicates that between 2015 and 2019 there has been improvement in physical status of primary health facilities as a result constructions, upgrading and equipping the facilities to offer safe surgery and related diagnostic services. Despite the achievements, still there is a high demand for good physical statuses and functioning of primary health facilities with capacity to offer essential and safe surgical services in the country also as an important strategy towards achieving {UHC}. This is also inline with the National Surgical, Obstetrics and Anesthesia plan ({NSOAP}).},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Tanzania remains among the countries with the highest burden of infectious diseases (notably {HIV}, Malaria and Tuberculosis) during pregnancy. In response, the country adopted World Health Organization’s ({WHO}) latest antenatal care ({ANC}) guidelines which recommend comprehensive services including diagnostic screening and treatment for pregnant women during antenatal. However, as Tanzania makes efforts to scale up these services under the existing health system resources, it is crucial to understand its capacity to deliver these services in an integrated fashion. Using the {WHO}’s service availability and readiness assessment({SARA}) framework, this study assesses the capacity of the Tanzanian Health System to provide integrated Malaria, Tuberculosis and {HIV} services.
            
            
              Methods
              Composite indicators of the five components of integration were constructed from primary datasets of the Tanzanian Service Provision Assessments ({SPA}) under the Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}) programs. Chi-squared analysis was conducted to determine the associations of each of the defined components and background characteristics of facilities/health workers. A logistic regression model was further used to explore strength of relationships between availability of service readiness components and a pregnant women’s receipt of {HIV}, Malaria and {TB} services by reporting adjusted odds ratios.
            
            
              Results
              
                Generally, capacity to integrate malaria services was significantly higher (72.3 95\% {CI} 70.3–74.4
                p = 0.02
                ) compared to Tuberculosis (48.9 95\% {CI} 48.4–50.7) and {HIV} (54.8 95\% {CI} 53.1–56.9) services. Diagnostic capacity was generally higher than treatment commodities. Regarding the components of {SARA} integration, logistic regression found that the adjusted odds ratio of having all five components of integration and receiving integrated care was 1.9 (95\% {CI} 0.8–2.7). Among these components, the strongest determinant (predictor) to pregnant women’s receipt of integrated care was having trained staff on site ({AOR} 2.6 95\% {CI} 0.6–4.5).
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Toward a successful integration of these services under the new {WHO} guidelines in Tanzania, efforts should be channelled into strengthening infectious disease care especially {HIV} and {TB}. Channelling investments into training of health workers (the strongest determinant to integrated care) is likely to result in positive outcomes for the pregnant woman and unborn child.},

This predicament has arisen because of ideological, not scientific, constraints on the field of demography--constraints that have a history in how the discipline was formed and financed and in how key demographic agendas become rationalized. The rise of modern feminism, with its commitment to greater gender equality and female empowerment, presents a challenge in this context; it has limited appeal to those who control key resources for demographic research. The article argues for the incorporation of a gender systems approach that directly addresses gender differences in power, autonomy, and well-being, at both the macro and micro levels, and for an expansion of data collection that will permit such analyses. By making gender central to the field, demography will become a more relevant science for understanding social inequality and population change.},

Methods The Malawi Service Provision Assessment 2013-2014 included 3149 outpatients aged 2-59 months with completed observations, interviews and re-examinations. Mixed-effects logistic regression models quantified the influence of patient-, provider and facility-level determinants on having {IMCI} non-severe pneumonia and its management in observed consultations. Findings Among 3149 eligible outpatients, 590 (18.7\%) had {IMCI} non-severe pneumonia classification in re-examination. 228 (38.7\%) classified cases received first-line antibiotics and 159 (26.9\%) received no antibiotics. 18.6\% with cough or difficult breathing had 60-second respiratory rates counted during consultations, and conducting this assessment was significantly associated with {IMCI} training ever received (odds ratio ({OR}) = 2.37, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}): 1.29-4.31) and negative rapid diagnostic test results ({OR} = 3.21, 95\% {CI}: 1.45-7.13). Older children had lower odds of assessments than infants ({OR} = 48-59 months: 0.35, 95\% {CI}: 0.16-0.75). Children presenting with any of the following complaints also had reduced odds of assessment: fever, diarrhea, skin problem or any danger sign. First-line antibiotic treatment for classified cases was significantly associated with high temperatures ({OR} = 3.26, 95\% {CI}: 1.24-8.55) while older children had reduced odds of first-line treatment compared to infants ({OR} = 48-59 months: 0.29, 95\% {CI}: 0.10-0.83). {RDT}-confirmed malaria was a significant predictor of no antibiotic receipt for {IMCI} non-severe pneumonia ({OR} = 10.65, 95\% {CI}: 2.39-47.36). Conclusions {IMCI} non-severe pneumonia care was sub-optimal in Malawi health facilities in 2013-2014 with inadequate assessments and prescribing practices that must be addressed to reduce this leading cause of mortality. Child's symptoms and age, malaria diagnosis and provider training were primary influences on assessment and treatment practices. Current evidence could be used to better target {IMCI} training and support to improve pneumonia care for sick children in Malawi facilities.},

To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, the rate of decline in prevalence of maternal and child mortality, stillbirths, and stunting among children younger than 5 years of age needs to accelerate considerably compared with progress since 2000. Such accelerations are only possible with a rapid scale-up of effective interventions to all population groups within countries (particularly in countries with the highest mortality and in those affected by conflict), supported by improvements in underlying socioeconomic conditions, including women's empowerment. Three main conclusions emerge from our analysis of intervention coverage, equity, and drivers of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health ({RMNCH}) in the 81 Countdown countries. First, even though strong progress was made in the coverage of many essential {RMNCH} interventions during the past decade, many countries are still a long way from universal coverage for most essential interventions. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence suggests that available services in many countries are of poor quality, limiting the potential effect on {RMNCH} outcomes. Second, within-country inequalities in intervention coverage are reducing in most countries (and are now almost non-existent in a few countries), but the pace is too slow. Third, health-sector (eg, weak country health systems) and non-health-sector drivers (eg, conflict settings) are major impediments to delivering high-quality services to all populations. Although more data for {RMNCH} interventions are available now, major data gaps still preclude the use of evidence to drive decision making and accountability. Countdown to 2030 is investing in improvements in measurement in several areas, such as quality of care and effective coverage, nutrition programmes, adolescent health, early childhood development, and evidence for conflict settings, and is prioritising its regional networks to enhance local analytic capacity and evidence for {RMNCH}.},

	abstract = {Background: Client satisfaction has been found to be an important factor for the uptake and continuation of family planning services. This study aimed to examine the current status of and factors associated with client's satisfaction with family planning services in Tanzania, which has a high unmet need for family planning. Methods: The study used data from the Tanzania Service Provision Assessment survey of 2014-2015. A facility was classified as having high service readiness for {FP} if it scored at least 67.7\% on a composite score based on three domains (staff training and guidelines, basic diagnostic equipment, and basic medicines), following criteria developed by the World Health Organization. The exit interview questionnaire was used to collect information from women about their level of satisfaction, whether “very satisfied,” “more or less satisfied,” or not satisfied with the services received. The response was dichotomized into “Yes” if the woman reported being very satisfied with services received otherwise coded as “No”. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used to assess the association between the client satisfaction and covariate variables; service readiness, facility type, managing authority, location, management meetings, supervision, provider's sex, and working experience, clients' age and education. All analyses were weighted to correct for non-response, disproportionate and complex sampling by using the “{SVY}” command in Stata 14. Results: Out of the 1188 facilities included in the survey, 427 (35.9\%) provided family planning services. A total of 1746 women participated in observations and exit interviews. Few (22\%) facilities had a high readiness to provide family planning services. While most facilities had the recommended equipment available, only 42\% stocked contraceptives (e.g. oral pills, injectable contraceptives and/or condoms). Further, trained staff and clinical guidelines were present in only 30\% of services. Nevertheless, the majority (91\%) of clients reported that they were satisfied with services. In the multivariate analysis, a high service readiness score [{AOR} = 2.5, 95\% {CI}; 1.1-6.0], receiving services from private facilities [{AOR} = 2.3, 95\% {CI}; 1.1-5.0], and being in the age group 20 to 29 years [{AOR} = 0.3, 95\% {CI}; 0.1-0.7] were all significantly associated with clients' satisfaction with family planning services. Conclusion: There is a high level of client satisfaction with family planning services in Tanzania. Maintaining and exceeding this level will require improvements in the provision of staff training and the availability of contraceptives in existing services.},

              Background
              Provider-initiated {HIV} testing and counseling ({PITC}) is a recommended approach to screen for {HIV} to all pregnant women during antenatal care ({ANC}) visits, and all with {HIV} positive results have to be enrolled into prevention of mother-to-child transmission of {HIV} ({PMTCT}) program. However, little is known about the relationship between facility readiness and the uptake of {PITC} to pregnant women attending {ANC} in Tanzania. Therefore, this study assessed whether the facility readiness promotes the uptake of {PITC} to the pregnant women attending {ANC} for the purpose of improving the {PMTCT} interventions in Tanzania.
            
            
              Methods
              
                This study analyzed data for health facilities obtained from the 2014–2015 Tanzania service provision assessment survey. The Primary outcome measure was a composite variable (with score of 0–5) in which its higher scores indicates provision of high-quality of {PITC}. Also, facilities scored higher in the {PMTCT} service readiness index were considered to have high readiness to provide {PMTCT} services. In Poisson regression analyses, a series of models were fitted to assess whether there is an association between provision of high-quality of {PITC} and facility readiness. In all statistical analysis, a
                P
                 {\textless} 0.05 was considered significant.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Out of 1853 included first-visit {ANC} consultations, only about one-third of pregnant women received all five components required for {PITC}. The mean percentage of {PMTCT} readiness score was moderate 63.96 [61.32–66.59]\%. In adjusted model, we found that facility with high readiness to provide {PMTCT} services was significantly associated with the provision of high-quality of {PITC} (model 2: [β = 0.075,
                P
                 = 0.00]).
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              In order to increase high-quality of {PITC} services, efforts should be made to improve the {PMTCT} facility readiness by increasing availability of trained staffs, diagnostic tools, and {ARTs} among health facilities in Tanzania.},

              Objectives
              Effective coverage ({EC}) is a measure of health systems’ performance that combines need, use and quality indicators. This study aimed to assess the extent to which the Kenyan health system provides effective and equitable maternal and child health services, as a means of tracking the country's progress towards universal health coverage.
            
            
              Methods and results
              The Demographic Health Surveys (2003, 2008–2009 and 2014) and Service Provision Assessment surveys (2004, 2010) were the main sources of data. Indicators of need, use and quality for eight maternal and child health interventions were aggregated across interventions and economic quintiles to compute {EC}. {EC} has increased from 26.7\% in 2003 to 50.9\% in 2014, but remains low for the majority of interventions. There is a reduction in economic inequalities in {EC} with the highest to lowest wealth quintile ratio decreasing from 2.41 in 2003 to 1.65 in 2014, but maternal health services remain highly inequitable.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Effective coverage of key maternal and child health services remains low, indicating that individuals are not receiving the maximum possible health gain from existing health services. There is an urgent need to focus on the quality and reach of maternal and child health services in Kenya to achieve the goals of universal health coverage.

              Objectifs
              La couverture effective est une mesure de la performance des systèmes de santé, qui combine le besoin, l'utilisation et la qualité. Cette étude visait à évaluer dans quelle mesure le système de santé kenyan fournit des services de santé maternelle et infantile effectives et équitables, afin de pouvoir suivre les progrès du pays vers une couverture universelle de santé.
            
            
              Méthodes et résultats
              Les enquêtes démographiques et de santé (2003, 2008‐2009 et 2014) et les enquêtes sur l’évaluation de la prestation des services (2004, 2010) ont été les principales sources de données. Les indicateurs de besoin, d'utilisation et de qualité de 8 interventions de santé maternelle et infantile ont été regroupés selon les interventions et les quintiles économiques pour calculer la couverture effective. La couverture effective est passée de 26,7\% en 2003 à 50,9\% en 2014, mais reste faible pour la majorité des interventions. Il y a eu une réduction des inégalités économiques dans la couverture effective avec le ratio entre le quintile de richesse le plus élevé et le plus bas, passant de 2,41 en 2003 à 1,65 en 2014, mais les services de santé maternelle demeurent très inéquitables.
            
            
              Conclusions
              La couverture effective des services de santé maternelle et infantile clés reste faible, ce qui indique que les gens ne reçoivent pas le maximum possible des bienfaits de la santé grâce aux services de santé existants. Il est urgemment nécessaire d'améliorer la qualité des services de santé maternelle et infantile au Kenya pour atteindre les objectifs d'une couverture universelle de santé.

              Objetivos
              La cobertura efectiva es una medida del desempeño de los sistemas sanitarios que combina necesidad, uso y calidad. Este estudio tenía como objetivo evaluar el alcance del sistema sanitario de Kenia para proveer servicios de atención materno‐infantil efectivos y equitativos, como una forma de trazabilidad del progreso del país hacia una cobertura sanitaria universal.
            
            
              Métodos y Resultados
              Los Censos Demográficos y Sanitarios (2003, 2008‐09 and 2014) y las Encuestas de Evaluación de Provisión de Servicios (2004, 2010) fueron las principales fuentes de datos. Los indicadores de necesidad, uso y calidad de 8 intervenciones sanitarias materno‐infantiles fueron agregadas a través de intervenciones y quintiles económicos para calcular la cobertura efectiva. La cobertura efectiva ha aumentado del 26.7\% en el 2003 al 50.9\% en el 2014, pero continúa siendo baja para la mayor parte de las intervenciones. Hay una reducción en las inequidades económicas en la cobertura efectiva, con la ratio del mayor a menor quintil de riqueza disminuyendo de 2.41 en el 2003 al 1.65 en el 2014, pero los servicios de salud materna continúan siendo altamente injustos.
            
            
              Conclusiones
              La cobertura efectiva de los principales servicios de salud materna e infantil continúa siendo baja, indicando que los individuos no están recibiendo las máximas ganancias posibles en salud de los servicios sanitarios existentes. Existe una necesidad urgente de mejorar la calidad de los servicios de salud materno‐infantil en Kenia para conseguir los objetivos de la cobertura sanitaria universal.},

	abstract = {Background Health service areas are essential for planning, policy and managing public health interventions. In this study, we delineate health service areas from routinely collected health data as a robust geographic basis for presenting access to maternal care indicators. Methods A zone design algorithm was adapted to delineate health service areas through a cross-sectional, ecological study design. Health sub-districts were merged into health service areas such that patient flows across boundaries were minimised. Delineated zones and existing administrative boundaries were used to provide estimates of access to maternal health services. We analysed secondary data comprising routinely collected health records from 32,921 women attending 27 hospitals to give birth, spatial demographic data, a service provision assessment on the quality of maternal healthcare and health sub-district boundaries from Eastern Region, Ghana. Results Clear patterns of cross border movement to give birth emerged from the analysis, but more women originated closer to the hospitals. After merging the 250 sub-districts in 33 districts, 11 health service areas were created. The minimum percent of internal flows of women giving birth within any health service area was 97.4\%. Because the newly delineated boundaries are more “natural” and sensitive to observed flow patterns, when we calculated areal indicator estimates, they showed a marked improvement over the existing administrative boundaries, with the inclusion of a hospital in every health service area. Conclusion Health planning can be improved by using routine health data to delineate natural catchment health districts. In addition, data-driven geographic boundaries derived from public health events will improve areal health indicator estimates, planning and interventions.},

	abstract = {Using the analytical framework of boundary-work, I examine how the cultural space of demography, its borders and its territories, were constructed and reconstructed as scientists continuously struggled to maintain, increase, and defend the cognitive authority of science and particular interpretations of reality. While the emerging field of population united both biologists and social scientists in the early 20th century, the controversy over the biologist Raymond Pearl's logistic curve in the inter-war period became one of the defining features in the development of the population sciences in the United States. Pearl's use of the logistic curve reflected his biologically determinist vision of human progress and the definition and function of science within that process. Pearl's critics, the majority numbered among the social sciences, opposed such an imperialistic vision. With the weakening of Pearl's influence, American demography was clearly defined as a social science. In disciplinary histories, Pearl's defeat is attributed to scientific progress and the collapse of credibility for the eugenics movement. Thus a history of a scientific progression from biological determinism to social empiricism is combined with a shift from population ideology to population science. Yet the attack on the biological laws in the 1930s had as much to do with differing opinions as how to best regulate a population according to eugenic standards, as it was a struggle between a biologically determinist eugenics and a social science of reform.},

As facility births increase, so does the recognition that {TMTS} causes harm and increases health costs, and often concentrates disrespect and abuse. Although {TMTS} is typically ascribed to high-income countries and {TLTL} to low-income and middle-income ones, social and health inequities mean these extremes coexist in many countries. A global approach to quality and equitable maternal health, supporting the implementation of respectful, evidence-based care for all, is urgently needed. We present a systematic review of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for routine antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care, categorising them as recommended, recommended only for clinical indications, and not recommended. We also present prevalence data from middle-income countries for specific clinical practices, which demonstrate {TLTL} and increasing {TMTS}. Health-care providers and health systems need to ensure that all women receive high-quality, evidence-based, equitable and respectful care.

We aimed to describe the need and access to care for people with {CVDRF} and the preparedness of the health system to treat these in Bo, Sierra Leone. Methods Data from a 2018 household survey conducted in Bo, Sierra Leone, was analysed. Demographic, anthropometric and clinical data on {CVDRF} (hypertension, diabetes mellitus or dyslipidaemia) from randomly sampled individuals 40 years of age and above were collected. Future risk of {CVD} was calculated using the World Health Organisation-International Society of Hypertension ({WHO}-{ISH}) calculator with high risk defined as ¿20\% risk over 10 years. Requirement for treatment was based on {WHO} package of essential non-communicable ({PEN}) disease guidelines (which use a risk-based approach) or requiring treatment for individual {CVDRF}; whether participants were on treatment was used to determine whether care needs were met. Multivariable regression was used to test associations between individual characteristics and outcomes. Data from the most recent {WHO} Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) were used to create a score reflecting health system preparedness to treat {CVDRF}, and compared to that for {HIV}. Results 2071 individual participants were included. Most participants (n = 1715 [94.0\%]) had low {CVD} risk; 423 (20.6\%) and 431 (52.3\%) required treatment based upon {WHO} {PEN} guidelines or individual {CVDRF}, respectively. Sixty-eight (15.8\%) had met-need for treatment determined by {WHO} guidelines, whilst 84 (19.3\%) for individual {CVDRF}. Living in urban areas, having education, being older, single/widowed/divorced, or wealthy were independently associated with met need. Overall facility readiness scores for {CVD}/{CVDRF} care for all facilities in Bo district was 16.8\%, compared to 41\% for {HIV}. Conclusion The number of people who require treatment for {CVDRF} in Sierra Leone is substantially lower based on {WHO} guidelines compared to {CVDRF}. {CVDRF} care needs are not met equitably, and facility readiness to provide care is low.},

              Background
              Nigeria faces an increase in the burden of non-communicable diseases ({NCDs}), including cardiovascular diseases ({CVDs}), leading to an estimated 29\% of all deaths in the country. Nigeria has an estimated hypertension prevalence ranging from 25 to 40\% of her adult population. Despite this high burden, awareness (14–30\%), treatment ({\textless} 20\%), and control (9\%) rates of hypertension are low in Nigeria. Against this backdrop, we sought to perform capacity and readiness assessments of public Primary Healthcare Centers ({PHCs}) to inform Nigeria’s system-level hypertension control program’s implementation and adaptation strategies.
            
            
              Methods
              The study employed a multi-stage sampling to select 60 from the 243 {PHCs} in the Federal Capital Territory ({FCT}) of Nigeria. The World Health Organization ({WHO}) Service Availability and Readiness Assessment was adapted to focus on hypertension diagnosis and treatment and was administered to {PHC} staff from May 2019 – October 2019. Indicator scores for general and cardiovascular service readiness were calculated based on the proportion of sites with available amenities, equipment, diagnostic tests, and medications.
            
            
              Results
              
                Median (interquartile range [{IQR}]) number of full-time staff was 5 (3–8), and were predominantly community health extension workers (median = 3 [{IQR} 2–5]). Few sites (
                n
                 = 8; 15\%) received cardiovascular disease diagnosis and management training within the previous 2 years, though most had sufficient capacity for screening (
                n
                 = 58; 97\%), diagnosis (
                n
                 = 56; 93\%), and confirmation (
                n
                 = 50; 83\%) of hypertension. Few {PHCs} had guidelines (
                n
                 = 7; 13\%), treatment algorithms (
                n
                 = 3; 5\%), or information materials (
                n
                 = 1; 2\%) for hypertension. Most sites (
                n
                 = 55; 92\%) had one or more functional blood pressure apparatus. All sites relied on paper records, and few had a functional computer (
                n
                 = 10; 17\%) or access to internet (
                n
                 = 5; 8\%). Despite inclusion on Nigeria’s essential medicines list, 35 (59\%) {PHCs} had zero 30-day treatment regimens of any blood pressure-lowering medications in stock.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              This first systematic assessment of capacity and readiness for a system-level hypertension control program within the {FCT} of Nigeria demonstrated implementation feasibility based on the workforce, equipment, and paper-based information systems, but a critical need for essential medicine supply strengthening, health-worker training, and protocols for hypertension treatment and control in Nigeria.},

The analysis of the relationship between {PHC} service delivery and child health outcomes revealed that recent supervision (b=0.34, p¡0.01) and supervisors' feedback (b=0.28, p¡0.05) were each associated with increased care-seeking for pneumonia. We also observed the associations of several measures of capacity and quality with {DPT} immunisation. The analysis of maternal health outcomes yielded only a few statistically significant results at p¡0.05 level, however, none remained significant after adjusting for other covariates.{ConclusionThe} results of this analysis illustrate the heterogeneity in the capacity and quality of {PHC} service delivery within {LMICs}.

In this paper, the Angolan {MIS} data were analyzed to produce the first smooth map of parasitaemia prevalence based on contemporary nationwide empirical data in the country. Bayesian geostatistical models were fitted to assess the effect of interventions after adjusting for environmental, climatic and socio-economic factors. Non-linear relationships between parasitaemia risk and environmental predictors were modeled by categorizing the covariates and by employing two non-parametric approaches, the B-splines and the P-splines. The results of the model validation showed that the categorical model was able to better capture the relationship between parasitaemia prevalence and the environmental factors. Model fit and prediction were handled within a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) simulations. Combining estimates of parasitaemia prevalence with the number of children under we obtained estimates of the number of infected children in the country. The population-adjusted prevalence ranges from in Namibe province to in Malanje province. The odds of parasitaemia in children living in a household with at least {ITNs} per person was by 41\% lower ({CI}: 14\%, 60\%) than in those with fewer {ITNs}. The estimates of the number of parasitaemic children produced in this paper are important for planning and implementing malaria control interventions and for monitoring the impact of prevention and control activities.},

              Background
              Poor awareness of obstetric danger signs is a major contributing factor to delays in seeking obstetric care and hence to high maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. We conducted the current study to assess the level of agreement on receipt of counseling on obstetric danger signs between direct observations of antenatal care ({ANC}) consultation and women’s recall in the exit interview. We also identified factors associated with pregnant women’s awareness of obstetric danger signs during pregnancy in the Democratic Republic of Congo ({DRC})
            
            
              Methods
              We used data from the 2017–2018 {DRC} Service Provision Assessment survey. Agreement between the observation and woman’s recall was measured using Cohen’s kappa statistic and percent agreement. Multivariable Zero-Inflated Poisson ({ZIP}) regression was used to identify factors associated with the number of danger signs during pregnancy the woman knew.
            
            
              Results
              On average, women were aware of 1.5 ± 1.34 danger signs in pregnancy (range: 0 to 8). Agreement between observation and woman’s recall was 70.7\%, with a positive agreement of 16.9\% at the country level but ranging from 2.1\% in Bandundu to 39.7\% in Sud Kivu. Using multivariable {ZIP} analysis, the number of obstetric danger signs the women mentioned was significantly higher in multigravida women (Adj.{IRR} = 1.38; 95\% {CI}: 1.23–1.55), in women attending a private facility (Adj.{IRR} = 1.15; 95\% {CI}: 1.01–1.31), in women attending a subsequent {ANC} visit (Adj.{IRR} = 1.11; 95\% {CI}: 1.01–1.21), and in women counseled on danger signs during the {ANC} visit (Adj.{IRR} = 1.19; 95\% {CI}: 1.05–1.35). There was a regional variation in the awareness of danger signs, with the least mentioned signs in the middle and the most in the eastern provinces.
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                Our findings indicated poor agreement between directly observed counseling and women’s reports that counseling on obstetric danger signs occurred during the current {ANC} visit. We found that province of residence
                ,
                provision of counseling on obstetric danger signs, facility ownership, gravidity and the number of {ANC} visits were predictors of the awareness of obstetric danger signs among pregnant women. These factors should be considered when developing strategies aim at improving women’s awareness about obstetric danger signs in the {DRC}},

	abstract = {Background
              Malawi has halved the neonatal mortality rate between 1990–2018, however, is not on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 12 per 1,000 live births. Despite a high facility birth rate (91\%), mother-newborn dyads may not remain in facilities long enough to receive recommended care and quality of care improvements are needed to reach global targets. Physical access and distance to health facilities remain barriers to quality postnatal care.
            
            
              Methods
              Using data We used individual data from the 2015–16 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey and facility data from the 2013–14 Malawi Service Provision Assessment, linking households to all health facilities within specified distances and travel times. We calculated service readiness scores for facilities to measure their capacity to provide birth/newborn care services. We fitted multi-level regression models to evaluate the association between the service readiness and appropriate newborn care (receiving at least five of six interventions).
            
            
              Results
              Households with recent births (n = 6010) linked to a median of two birth facilities within 5–10 km and one facility within a two-hour walk. The maximum service environment scores for linked facilities median was 77.5 for facilities within 5–10 km and 75.5 for facilities within a two-hour walk. While linking to one or more facilities within 5-10km or a two-hour walk was not associated with appropriate newborn care, higher levels of service readiness in nearby facilities was associated with an increased risk of appropriate newborn care.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Women’s choice of nearby facilities and quality facilities is limited. High quality newborn care is sub-optimal despite high coverage of facility birth and some newborn care interventions. While we did not find proximity to more facilities was associated with increased risk of appropriate care, high levels of service readiness was, showing facility birth and improved access to well-prepared facilities are important for improving newborn care.},

              We assessed the availability and readiness of health facilities to provide sexually transmitted infections ({STI}) and {HIV} testing and counselling ({HTC}) services in Nepal.
            
            
              Design
              This was a cross-sectional study.
            
            
              Setting
              We used data from the most recent nationally representative Nepal Health Facility Survey ({NHFS}) 2015. A total of 963 health facilities were surveyed with 97\% response rate.
            
            
              Primary and secondary outcome measures
              The primary outcome of this study was to assess the availability and readiness of health facilities to provide {STI} and {HTC} services using the {WHO} Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) manual.
            
            
              Results
              Nearly three-fourths (73.8\%) and less than one-tenth (5.9\%) of health facilities reported providing {STI} and {HTC} services, respectively. The mean readiness score of {STI} and {HTC} services was 26.2\% and 68.9\%, respectively. The readiness scores varied significantly according to the managing authority (private vs public) for both {STI} and {HTC} services. Interestingly, health facilities with external supervision had better service readiness scores for {STI} services that were almost four points higher than compared with those facilities with no external supervision. Regarding {HTC} services, service readiness was lower at private hospitals (32.9 points lower) compared to government hospitals. Unlike {STI} services, the readiness of facilities to provide {HTC} services was higher (4.8 point higher) at facilities which performed quality assurance.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The facility readiness for {HTC} service is higher than that for {STI} services. There are persistent gaps in staff, guidelines and medicine and commodities across both services. Government of Nepal should focus on ensuring constant supervision and quality assurance, as these were among the determining factors for facility readiness.},

              Background
              Provider-Initiated {HIV} Testing and Counseling ({PITC}) and Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission ({PMTCT}) are key services for achieving the goal of complete elimination of {HIV}. However, there is limited evidence on the ability of health facilities to provide these services in Burkina Faso. Therefore, we aimed to assess the trends and disparities in the availability and readiness of health facilities to provide {PITC} and {PMTCT} services in Burkina Faso between 2012 and 2018.
            
            
              Methods
              We performed a secondary analysis of facility-level data from the World Health Organization’s Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) surveys conducted in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 in Burkina Faso. The availability and readiness of health facilities were assessed using {SARA}’s manual, and linear regressions were used to examine trends.
            
            
              Results
              
                Between 2012 and 2018, the mean proportion of health facilities providing {PITC} services increased, but not significantly, from 82.9\% to 83.4\% (
                p
                 = 0.11), with the mean readiness index significantly decreasing from 71.5\% to 65.4\% (
                p
                 {\textless} 0.001). This decrease concerned the staff and guidelines (73.8\% to 50.5\%;
                p
                 {\textless} 0.001), equipment (79.0\% to 77.4\%;
                p
                 {\textless} 0.001), and medicines and commodities (54.2\% to 45.2\%;
                p
                 {\textless} 0.001) domains. Regarding the {PMTCT} services, the mean proportion of health facilities globally providing the service significantly decreased from 83.7\% in 2012 to 67.7\% (
                p
                 = 0.030) in 2018, and the mean readiness significantly decreased from 53.2\% in 2012 to 50.9\% in 2018 (
                p
                 = 0.004). This decreasing trend was related to the staff and training (80.3\% to 57.6\%;
                p
                 {\textless} 0.001) and medicines and commodities (9.2\% to 6.5\%;
                p
                 {\textless} 0.001) domains. The global significant negative trend of readiness was mainly observed at the primary level of healthcare (52.7\% to 49.4\%;
                p
                 = 0.030). Four regions experienced a significant decrease in the readiness index of health facilities to provide {PMTCT} services: Cascades, Centre, Centre-Sud, and Sud-Ouest, while Haut-Bassins and Nord regions showed increasing trends.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Availability and readiness of health facilities to provide {PITC} and {PMTCT} remain suboptimal in Burkina Faso. Actions to strengthen the skills of professionals and enhance the availability of medicines and commodities while focusing more on health regions with significant decreasing trends are urgently needed to improve the quality of services for {HIV}.},

              Background:
              Baseline assessment of standard precaution relating to infection prevention and control ({IPC}) preparedness to fight health crisis within healthcare facilities at different levels and its associated factors in Bangladesh remains unknown.
            
            
              Methods:
              We analyzed the nationally representative Bangladesh health facility survey ({BHFS}) data conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare ({MoHFW}) during July–October 2017. We used the World Health Organization ({WHO}) Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) manual to determine the standard precautions related to the {IPC} readiness index. Using a conceptual framework and multivariable linear regression, we identified the factors associated with the readiness index.
            
            
              Results:
              We analyzed data for 1,524 surveyed healthcare facilities. On average, only 44\% of the standard precaution elements were available in all facilities. Essential elements, such as guidelines for standard precautions (30\%), hand-washing soap (29\%), and pedal bins (38\%), were not readily available in all facilities. The tuberculosis service area was least prepared, with 85\% of elements required for standard precaution deficient in all facilities. Significantly lower readiness indexes were observed in the rural healthcare facilities (mean difference, −13.2), healthcare facilities administered by the {MoHFW} (mean difference, −7.8), and private facilities (mean difference, −10.1) compared to corresponding reference categories.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Our study revealed a severe lack of standard precaution elements in most healthcare facilities, particularly in rural health centers. These data can provide a baseline from which to measure improvement in infection prevention and control ({IPC}) in these facilities and to identify areas of gaps for targeted interventions to improve {IPC} strategies that can improve the Bangladesh health system.},

	abstract = {Introduction Vietnam aims for 95\% of commune health stations ({CHSs}) to have functional hypertension management programs by 2025. However, limited resources may impede the Central Highland region health system from achieving this goal. We assessed the availability and readiness of hypertension management services at {CHSs} in the Central Highland region and identified challenges to facilitate evidence-based planning. Methods We used a mixed-methods cross-sectional design to assess hypertension management services using {WHO}'s service availability and readiness assessment ({SARA}) tools in all 579 {CHSs} in the region, combined with twenty in-depth interviews of hypertension program focal points at communal, district, and provincial levels in all four provinces. We descriptively analyzed quantitative data and thematically analyzed qualitative data. Results Hypertension management services were available at 65\% of {CHSs}, and the readiness of the services was 62\%. The urban areas had higher availability and readiness indices in most domains (basic amenities, basic equipment, and essential medicines) compared to rural areas, except for staff and training. The qualitative results showed a lack of trained staff and ambiguity in national hypertension treatment guidelines, insufficient essential medicines supply mechanism, and low priority and funding limitations for the hypertension program. Conclusion The overall availability and readiness for hypertension diagnosis and management service at {CHSs} in the Central Highland region were low, reflecting inadequate capacity of the primary healthcare facilities. Some measures to strengthen hypertension programs in the region might include increased financial support, ensuring a sufficient supply of basic medicines, and providing more specific treatment guidelines.},

	volume = {16},
	issn = {1549-1277},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pmed.1002869},
	abstract = {Author {summaryWhy} was this study done? One of the largest contributors to preventable deaths in low- and middle-income countries is poor quality of care delivered by the public health system. Yet, given the multiple dimensions of care quality, there are currently no standard measures to evaluate impacts in this domain. While health system strengthening ({HSS}) initiatives strive to simultaneously increase access to healthcare and improve care quality, few studies have evaluated the impact of {HSS} initiatives on both targets. Our study sought to determine whether an {HSS} intervention in a rural health district of Madagascar, one of the world's poorest countries, improved the quality of maternal and child care at the population level. What did the researchers do and find? We used data from a district-representative open longitudinal cohort that followed over 1,500 households between 2014 and 2016, in order to compare trends in the content of care as a proxy for care quality, inside and outside the intervention catchment, through difference-in-differences analyses. We also analysed data from a Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) conducted in health facilities supported by the {HSS} intervention. Our data set included self-reported information on health seeking behaviors and care content for common illnesses of children under five ( = 657 in 2014; 411 in 2016), and for maternal care before and during live births that occurred in the previous two years ( = 552 in 2014; 524 in 2016). {nnWe} found that compared to the non-intervention group, the intervention group experienced a larger improvement in most care content outputs for childhood illnesses (e.g., 24.4\% more children with diarrhea were prescribed oral rehydration therapy after two years than in the non-intervention area) and for perinatal care, whereas trends in antenatal care content were more similar in both populations. Despite progress, there remained important gaps in the provision of essential health services for individuals in both the intervention and non-intervention groups. What do these findings mean? The study provides evidence that {HSS} initiatives can successfully increase access to healthcare in target populations while also improving the quality of certain primary care services provided. The approach used here can be adapted to other local {HSS} initiatives to stimulate more comprehensive impact evaluations. Evidence from this study can help guide investments in integrated primary care systems that are needed globally to improve maternal and child care. The interpretation of the study findings is limited by the absence of randomization in the allocation of the intervention's programs and by the reliance on self-reported answers. Background In order to reach the health-related Sustainable Development Goals ({SDGs}) by 2030, gains attained in access to primary healthcare must be matched by gains in the quality of services delivered. Despite the broad consensus around the need to address quality, studies on the impact of health system strengthening ({HSS}) have focused predominantly on measures of healthcare access. Here, we examine changes in the content of maternal and child care as a proxy for healthcare quality, to better evaluate the effectiveness of an {HSS} intervention in a rural district of Madagascar. The intervention aimed at improving system readiness at all levels of care (community health, primary health centers, district hospital) through facility renovations, staffing, equipment, and training, while removing logistical and financial barriers to medical care (e.g., ambulance network and user-fee exemptions). Methods and findings We carried out a district-representative open longitudinal cohort study, with surveys administered to 1,522 households in the Ifanadiana district of Madagascar at the start of the {HSS} intervention in 2014, and again to 1,514 households in 2016. We examined changes in healthcare seeking behavior and outputs for sick-child care among children ¡5 years old, as well as for antenatal care and perinatal care among women aged 15-49. We used a difference-in-differences ({DiD}) analysis to compare trends between the intervention group (i.e., people living inside the {HSS} catchment area) and the non-intervention comparison group (i.e., the rest of the district). In addition, we used health facility-based surveys, monitoring service availability and readiness, to assess changes in the operational capacities of facilities supported by the intervention. The cohort study included 657 and 411 children (mean age = 2 years) reported to be ill in the 2014 and 2016 surveys, respectively (27.8\% and 23.8\% in the intervention group for each survey), as well as 552 and 524 women (mean age = 28 years) reported to have a live birth within the previous two years in the 2014 and 2016 surveys, respectively (31.5\% and 29.6\% in the intervention group for each survey). Over the two-year study period, the proportion of people who reported seeking care at health facilities experienced a relative change of +51.2\% (from 41.4\% in 2014 to 62.5\% in 2016) and -7.1\% (from 30.0\% to 27.9\%) in the intervention and non-intervention groups, respectively, for sick-child care ({DiD} p-value = 0.01); +11.4\% (from 78.3\% to 87.2\%), and +10.3\% (from 67.3\% to 74.2\%) for antenatal care (p-value = 0.75); and +66.2\% (from 23.1\% to 38.3\%) and +28.9\% (from 13.9\% to 17.9\%) for perinatal care (p-value = 0.13). Most indicators of care content, including rates of medication prescription and diagnostic test administration, appeared to increase more in the intervention compared to in the non-intervention group for the three areas of care we assessed. The reported prescription rate for oral rehydration therapy among children with diarrhea changed by +68.5\% (from 29.6\% to 49.9\%) and -23.2\% (from 17.8\% to 13.7\%) in the intervention and non-intervention groups, respectively (p-value = 0.05). However, trends observed in the care content varied widely by indicator and did not always match the large apparent increases observed in care seeking behavior, particularly for antenatal care, reflecting important gaps in the provision of essential health services for individuals who sought care. The main limitation of this study is that the intervention catchment was not randomly allocated, and some demographic indicators were better for this group at baseline than for the rest of the district, which could have impacted the trends observed. Conclusion Using a district-representative longitudinal cohort to assess the content of care delivered to the population, we found a substantial increase over the two-year study period in the prescription rate for ill children and in all World Health Organization ({WHO})-recommended perinatal care outputs assessed in the intervention group, with more modest changes observed in the non-intervention group. Despite improvements associated with the {HSS} intervention, this study highlights the need for further quality improvement in certain areas of the district's healthcare system. We show how content of care, measured through standard population-based surveys, can be used as a component of {HSS} impact evaluations, enabling healthcare leaders to track progress as well as identify and address specific gaps in the provision of services that extend beyond care access.},

The purpose of this study is to contribute with evidence for decision-making on the reform of the country’s healthcare map, by analyzing the availability and readiness of services at the facilities that may become part of a Hospital Complex in Bissau, proposed in the National Health Development Plan.Material and Methods: We analyzed 13 public and private facilities with inpatient capacity, located in Bissau and Biombo. Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) tools were used for data collection, treatment and analysis.Results: A comprehensive overview of these facilities has been provided, describing their general capacity to provide care and their readiness to implement it, along with the availability and readiness of specific services: diagnosis, family planning, mother and child health, obstetrics, communicable and non communicable diseases, blood transfusion and surgery. We observed a greater concentration of beds and professionals in the facilities of public sector, the only that provides all the specific services analyzed. Private sector services with agreements to supply the public sector have higher readiness levels and the private sector has the lowest operating capacity.Discussion: Findings reflect the lack of equipment, infrastructure and resources, the predominance of the public sector and the growth of the private for-profit and non-profit sectors, as well as inadequacies in planning and regulation. Similarities and differences between our findings and those described in the literature for other African countries are identified.Conclusion: This study reinforces the relevance of developing integrated and rational responses of health services and provides evidence for this.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Chronic Respiratory Diseases ({CRDs}) are some of the most prevailing non-communicable diseases ({NCDs}) worldwide and cause three times higher morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries ({LMIC}) than in developed nations. In Bangladesh, there is a dearth of data about the quality of {CRD} management in health facilities. This study aims to describe {CRD} service availability and readiness at all tiers of health facilities using the World Health Organization’s ({WHO}) Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) tool.
            
            
              Methods
              A cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2017 to June 2018 in a total of 262 health facilities in Bangladesh using the {WHO} {SARA} Standard Tool. Surveys were conducted with facility management personnel by trained data collectors using {REDCap} software. Descriptive statistics for the availability of {CRD} services were calculated. Composite scores for facility readiness (Readiness Index ‘{RI}’) were created which included four domains: staff and guideline, basic equipment, diagnostic capacity, and essential medicines. {RI} was calculated for each domain as the mean score of items expressed as a percentage. Indices were compared to a cutoff of70\% which means that a facility index above 70\% is considered ‘ready’ to manage {CRDs} at that level. Data analysis was conducted using {SPSS} Vr 21.0.
            
            
              Results
              It was found, tertiary hospitals were the only hospitals that surpassed the readiness index cutoff of 70\%, indicating that they had adequate capacity and were ready to manage {CRDs} ({RI} 78.3\%). The mean readiness scores for the other hospital tiers in descending order were District Hospitals ({DH}): 40.6\%, Upazila Health Complexes ({UHC}): 33.3\% and Private {NGOs}: 39.5\%).
            
            
              Conclusion
              Only tertiary care hospitals, constituting 3.1\% of sampled health facilities, were found ready to manage {CRD}. Inadequate and unequal supplies of medicine as well as a lack of trained staff, guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of {CRDs}, equipment, and diagnostic facilities contributed to low readiness index scores in all other tiers of health facilities.},

              Background
              The second most common cancer among females in Bangladesh is cervical cancer. The national strategy for cervical cancer needs monitoring to ensure that patients have access to care. In order to provide accurate information to policymakers in Bangladesh and other low and middle income countries, it is vital to assess current service availability and readiness to manage cervical cancer at health facilities in Bangladesh.
            
            
              Methods
              An interviewer-administered questionnaire adapted from the World Health Organization Service Availability and Readiness Assessment Standard Tool was used to collect cross-sectional data from health administrators of 323 health facilities in Bangladesh. Services provided were categorized into domains and service readiness was determined by mean readiness index ({RI}) scores. Data analysis was conducted using {STATA} version 13.
            
            
              Results
              There were seven tertiary and specialized hospitals, 118 secondary level health facilities, 124 primary level health facilities, and 74 {NGO}/private hospitals included in the study. Twenty-six per cent of the health facilities provided services to cancer patients. Among the 34 tracer items used to assess cancer management capacity of health facilities, four cervical cancer-specific tracer items were used to determine service readiness for cervical cancer. On average, tertiary and specialized hospitals surpassed the readiness index cutoff of 70\% with adequate staff and training (100\%), equipment (100\%), and diagnostic facilities (85.7\%), indicating that they were ready to manage cervical cancer. The mean {RI} scores for the rest of the health facilities were below the cutoff value, meaning that they were not prepared to provide adequate cervical cancer services.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The health facilities in Bangladesh (except for some tertiary hospitals) lack readiness in cervical cancer management in terms of guidelines on diagnosis and treatment, training of staff, and shortage of equipment. Given that cervical cancer accounts for more than one-fourth of all female cancers in Bangladesh, management of cervical cancer needs to be available at all levels of health facilities, with primary level facilities focusing on early diagnosis. It is recommended that appropriate standard operating procedures on cervical cancer be developed for each level of health facilities to contribute towards attaining sustainable developmental goals.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Diabetes Mellitus ({DM}) is one of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases ({NCDs})as well as a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Around 80\% diabetic patients live in low- and middle-income countries. In Bangladesh, there is a scarcity of data on the quality of {DM} management within health facilities. This study aims to describe service availability and readiness for {DM} at all tiers of health facilities using the World Health Organization’s ({WHO}) Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) standard tool.
            
            
              Methods
              This cross-sectional survey was conducted in 266 health facilities all across Bangladesh using the {WHO} {SARA} standard tool. Descriptive analyses for the availability of {DM} services was carried out. Composite scores for facility readiness index ({RI}) were calculated in four domains: staff and guideline, basic equipment, diagnostic capacity, and essential medicines. Indices were stratified by facility level and a cut off value of 70\% was considered as ‘ready’ to manage diabetes at each facility level.
            
            
              Results
              The mean {RI} score of tertiary and specialized hospitals was above the cutoff value of 70\% ({RI}: 79\%), whereas for District Hospitals ({DHs}), Upazila Health Complexes ({UHCs}) and {NGO} and Private hospitals the {RI} scores were other levels of 65\%, 51\% and 62\% respectively. This indicating that only the tertiary level of health facilities was ready to manage {DM}. However, it has been observed that the {RI} scores of the essential medicine domain was low at all levels of health facilities including tertiary-level.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The study revealed only tertiary level facilities were ready to manage {DM}. However, like other facilities, they require an adequate supply of essential medicines. Alongside the inadequate supply of medicines, shortage of trained staff and unavailability of guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of {DM} also contributed to the low {RI} score for rest of the facilities.},

Design/methodology/{approachRural} Health Statistics data and National Sample Survey Office Report for the period 2019-10 were used to analyze lower-level public health facilities, namely, subcenters, primary health centers and community health centers ({CHCs}). Selected tracer indicators under World Health Organization's ({WHO}) Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) mechanism such as health center density, core health workforce density and basic amenities were used to carry out the analysis. The extent of facility coverage was measured using the National Rural Health Mission ({NRHM}) guidelines and the proportion of facilities satisfying the Indian Public Health Standards ({IPHS}) was measured to assess the service provision quality in rural public health-care facilities. {FindingsResults} indicated that the density of public health centers is higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Almost all public health-care facilities lack basic amenities in rural areas. Working positions for health specialists in {CHCs} barely meet the total requirement. Almost all of the public health facilities functioning in rural areas do not meet the {IPHS} norms.

One of these tenets, proximity to food resources, which is used to measure food deserts, can be measured within a digital {GIS} (Geographic Information System). Metrics such as Euclidean and network distance represent planimetric distance measurements between locations and resources, but do not truly represent the empirical cost that serves as a barrier, most notably time and/or money, to those who must decide to travel to these resources. While the vector data model has been the standard by which these calculations are done within a {GIS}, raster-based travel time surfaces can serve as a faster, replicable and scalable alternative. However, little research has been done to test the efficacy of these surfaces and their alignment with vector-based network calculations. In this research, we developed two travel-time surfaces for a rural region in southeastern North Carolina. One represented travel times to grocery stores and while the other represented travel time to convenience stores. We found that the travel times derived from this surface were statistically consistent with vector-based counterparts for sample sizes at a 95\% confidence. When utilized correctly using an appropriate scale and spatial resolution, these surfaces have the potential to be effective tools in the study of food deserts.},

              Background
              Access to and delivery of comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care ({CEmONC}) services are often weak in low and middle-income countries affecting maternal and infant health outcomes. There are no studies on resources for maternal healthcare in the Northern region of Ghana. This knowledge is vital for health service planning and mobilising funding to address identified gaps. We investigated the available resources for managing {CEmONC} and referral services in the region.
            
            
              Methods
              This study involved a cross-sectional survey of maternity facilities in ten hospitals in the Northern region of Ghana, serving a population of 2,479,461, including 582,897 women aged 15–49. Public and faith-based hospitals were included in the study. We used the Service Provision Assessment tool to gather data for this study between October and December 2019. Given the small sample size, we used descriptive statistics to summarise the data using {SPSS} version 25 and Excel 2016.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 22,271 {ANC} visits from women to these hospitals occurred in the past 3 months preceding the study; however, 6072 birth events (cases) occurred within the same period. All the hospitals had less than one general medical doctor per 10,000 population (range 0.02–0.30). The number of midwives per 10,000 population ranged from 0.00 (facility H and J) to 1.87 (facility E), and none of the hospitals had a university-trained nurse designated for maternity care. Only one hospital had complete equipment for emergency obstetric and newborn care, while four others had adequate emergency obstetric care equipment. The number of maternity and delivery beds per 10,000 population was low, ranging from 0.40 to 2.13.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The management of emergency obstetric care and referrals are likely to be affected by the limited human resources and equipment in hospitals in Northern Ghana. Financial and non-financial incentives to entice midwives, obstetricians and medical officers to the Northern region should be implemented. Resources should be mobilised to improve the availability of essential equipment such as vacuum extractors and reliable ambulances to enhance referral services. Considerable health system strengthening efforts are required to achieve the required standards.},

	abstract = {Although Pakistan's Essential Package of Health Services was recently updated to include therapeutic and post-abortion care, little is known about current health facility readiness for these services. This study assessed the availability of comprehensive abortion care, and readiness of health facilities to deliver these services, within the public sector in 12 districts of Pakistan. A facility inventory was completed in 2020-2021 using the {WHO} Service Availability and Readiness Assessment, with a newly developed abortion module. A composite readiness indicator was developed based on national clinical guidelines and previous studies. Just 8.4\% of facilities reported offering therapeutic abortion, while 14.3\% offered post-abortion care. Misoprostol (75.2\%) was the most common method provided by facilities that offer therapeutic abortion, followed by vacuum aspiration (60.7\%) and dilatation and curettage (D\&C) (59\%). Few facilities had all the readiness components required to deliver pharmacological or surgical therapeutic abortion, or post-abortion care (¡1\%), but readiness was higher in tertiary (22.2\%) facilities. Readiness scores were lowest for “guidelines and personnel” (4.1\%), and slightly higher for medicines and products (14.3-17.1\%), equipment (16.3\%) and laboratory services (7.4\%). This assessment highlights the potential to increase the availability of comprehensive abortion care in Pakistan, particularly in primary care and in rural areas, to improve the readiness of health facilities to deliver these services, and to phase out non-recommended methods of abortion (D\&C). The study also demonstrates the feasibility and utility of adding an abortion module to routine health facility assessments, which can inform efforts to strengthen sexual and reproductive health and rights.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12913-017-1987-8},
	abstract = {Background: Cardiovascular diseases ({CVDs}) are the leading cause of global mortality. Among the {CVDs}, acute vascular events ({AVE}) mainly ischemic heart diseases and stroke are the largest contributors. To achieve 25\% reduction in preventable deaths from {CVDs} by 2025, health systems need to be equipped with extended service coverage in order to provide person-centered care. The overall goal of this proposed study is to assess access to health care in-terms of service availability, care seeking patterns and barriers to access care after {AVE} in rural Bangladesh. We will consider myocardial infarction ({MI}) and stroke as acute vascular events. Methods/Design: We will conduct a mixed methods study in rural Matlab, Bangladesh. This study will comprise of a) health facility survey, b) structured questionnaire interview and c) qualitative study. We will assess service availabilities by creating an inventory of public and private health facilities. Readiness of the facilities to deliver services for {AVE} will be assessed through a health facility survey using `service availability and readiness assessment' ({SARA}) tools of the World Health Organization ({WHO}). We will interview survivors of {AVE} and caregivers (present and accompanied the person during the event) of person who died from {AVE} for exploring patterns of care seeking during an {AVE}. For exploring barriers to access care for {AVE}, we will conduct in-depth interview with survivors of {AVE} and caregivers of the person who died from {AVE}. We will also conduct key informant interviews with the service providers at primary health care ({PHC}) facilities and government high level officials at central health administration of Bangladesh. Discussion: This study will provide a comprehensive picture of access to primary health care services during acute cardiovascular events as stroke \& {MI} in rural context of Bangladesh. It will explore available service facilities in rural area for management, utilization of services and barriers to access care during an acute emergency. This study will help to generate hypothesis, develop programs and policies for better access to care for {AVE} in similar rural settings considering barriers of access and improving utilization.},

	abstract = {Background: Several malaria vaccines are currently in clinical trials and are expected to provide an improved strategy for malaria control. Prior to introduction of a new vaccine, policymakers must consider the socio cultural environment of the region to ensure widespread community approval. This study investigated the acceptance of a malaria vaccine by child caregivers and analysed factors that influence these. Methods: Interviews from a standard questionnaire were conducted with 2,003 caregivers at 695 randomly selected health facilities across Kenya during the Kenya Service Provision Assessment Survey 2010. Multinomial regression of quantitative data was conducted using {STATA} to analyse determinants of caregivers accepting malaria vaccination of their child. Results: Mothers represented 90\% of caregivers interviewed who brought their child to the health facility, and 77\% of caregivers were 20-34 years old. Overall, 88\% of respondents indicated that they would accept a malaria vaccine, both for a child in their community and their own child. Approval for a vaccine was highest in malaria-endemic Nyanza Province at 98.9\%, and lowest in the seasonal transmission area of North Eastern Province at 23\%. Although 94\% of respondents who had attended at least some school reported they would accept the vaccine for a child, only 56\% of those who had never attended school would do so. The likelihood of accepting one's own child to be immunized was correlated with province, satisfaction with health care services in the facility attended, age of the caregiver, and level of education. Conclusions: Results from this study indicate a need for targeted messages and education on a malaria vaccine, particularly for residents of regions where acceptance is low, older caregivers, and those with low literacy and school-attendance levels. This study provides critical evidence to inform policy for a new malaria vaccine that will support its timely and comprehensive uptake in Kenya.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12913-023-09647-6},
	abstract = {{BackgroundThe} Democratic Republic of Congo ({DRC}) legalized abortion in 2018 to preserve health and pledged to provide quality postabortion care ({PAC}), yet little is known about the availability of abortion care services and if facilities are prepared to provide them; even less is known about the accessibility of these services. Using facility and population-based data in Kinshasa and Kongo Central, this study examined the availability of abortion services, readiness of facilities to provide them, and inequities in access.{MethodsData} on 153 facilities from the 2017-2018 {DRC} Demographic and Health Survey Service Provision Assessment ({SPA}) were used to examine signal functions and readiness of facilities to provide services across three abortion care domains (termination of pregnancy, basic treatment of abortion complications, and comprehensive treatment of abortion complications). To examine {PAC} and medication abortion provision before and after abortion decriminalization, we compared estimates from the 2017-2018 {SPA} facilities to estimates from the Performance Monitoring for Action ({PMA}) data collected in 2021 (n = 388). Lastly, we assessed proximity to {PAC} and medication abortion using {PMA} by geospatially linking facilities to representative samples of 2,326 and 1,856 women in Kinshasa and Kongo Central, respectively.{ResultsFew} facilities had all the signal functions under each abortion care domain, but most facilities had many of the signal functions: overall readiness scores were ¿ 60\% for each domain. In general, readiness was higher among referral facilities compared to primary facilities. The main barriers to facility readiness were stock shortages of misoprostol, injectable antibiotics, and contraception. Overall, provision of services was higher post-decriminalization. Access to facilities providing {PAC} and medication abortion was almost universal in urban Kinshasa, but patterns in rural Kongo Central showed a positive association with education attainment and wealth.{ConclusionMost} facilities had many of the necessary signal functions to provide abortion services, but the majority experienced challenges with commodity availability. Inequities in accessibility of services also existed. Interventions that address supply chain challenges may improve facility readiness to provide abortion care services, and further efforts are needed to narrow the gap in accessibility, especially among poor women from rural settings.},

	abstract = {Background
              Patients admitted to intensive care units ({ICU}) are at an increased risk of developing immobility related complications. Physiotherapists are challenged to employ preventive and rehabilitative strategies to combat these effects. Passive limb range of motion ({PROM}) exercises- a part of early mobilization-aid in maintaining joint range of motion and functional muscle strength and forms a part of treatment for patients in {ICU}. However, there is a lack of evidence on practice of {PROM} exercises on patients admitted to {ICU} in the United Arab Emirates ({UAE}). This study aimed at exploring practices regarding the same in {UAE}.
            
            
              Methods
              This survey, conducted from January 2021 to February 2021 in College of Physiotherapy, Sharjah University studied practice of physiotherapists in the intensive care units. Physiotherapists currently working in {ICU} completed an online questionnaire composed of forty-two questions about physiotherapy service provision, assessment and intervention in the intensive care units.
            
            
              Results
              33 physiotherapists completed the survey. 66.6\% of respondents routinely assessed {PROM} for all the patients in {ICU} referred for physiotherapy. 84.8\% of them assessed all the joints. More than half of the respondents (57.8\%) reported that they administered {PROM} regularly to all the patients. According to 63.6\% respondents, maintaining joint range of motion was the main reason for performing {PROM}. Responses pertaining to sets and repetitions of {PROM} were variable ranging from 1–6 sets and from 3 to 30 repetitions. Personal experience, resources/financial consideration and research findings were found to have influence on the practice.
            
            
              Conclusions
              {PROM} was found to be one of the frequently used mobilization techniques administered by physiotherapists in the intensive care units and was mostly performed after assessment. Maintaining joint range of motion was the main aim for performing {PROM}. Variability was found in the sets and repetitions of {PROM} administered. Various factors influenced the practice of {PROM}.},

              Background
              With the 40th anniversary of the Declaration of Alma-Ata, a global effort is underway to re-focus on strengthening primary health care systems, with emphasis on leveraging community health workers ({CHWs}) towards the goal of achieving universal health coverage for all. Institutionalizing effective, sustainable community health systems is currently limited by a lack of standard metrics for measuring {CHW} performance and the systems they work within. Developed through iterative consultations, supported by the Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation and in partnership with {USAID} and {UNICEF}, this paper details a framework, list of indicators, and measurement considerations for monitoring {CHW} performance in low- and middle-income countries.
            
            
              Methods
              A review of peer-reviewed articles, reports, and global data collection tools was conducted to identify key measurement domains in monitoring {CHW} performance. Three consultations were successively convened with global stakeholders, community health implementers, advocates, measurement experts, and Ministry of Health representatives using a modified Delphi approach to build consensus on priority indicators. During this process, a structured, web-based survey was administered to identify the importance and value of specific measurement domains, sub-domains, and indicators determined through the literature reviews and initial stakeholder consultations. Indicators with more than 75\% support from participants were further refined with expert qualitative input.
            
            
              Results
              Twenty-one sub-domains for measurement were identified including measurement of incentives for {CHWs}, supervision and performance appraisal, data use, data reporting, service delivery, quality of services, {CHW} absenteeism and attrition, community use of services, experience of services, referral/counter-referral, credibility/trust, and programmatic costs. Forty-six indicators were agreed upon to measure the sub-domains. In the absence of complete population enumeration and digitized health information systems, the quality of metrics to monitor {CHW} programs is limited.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Better data collection approaches at the community level are needed to strengthen management of {CHW} programs and community health systems. The proposed list of metrics balances exhaustive and pragmatic measurement of {CHW} performance within primary healthcare systems. Adoption of the proposed framework and associated indicators by {CHW} program implementors may improve programmatic effectiveness, strengthen their accountability to national community health systems, drive programmatic quality improvement, and plausibly improve the impact of these programs.},

The purpose of this study was to descriptively evaluate psychiatric music therapists and their institutions, philosophies, interventions, and clinical objectives. A survey was designed and posted online or mailed to music therapists who did not have email addresses in the 2005 Member Sourcebook ({AMTA}, 2005). A total of 176 psychiatric music therapists completed various parts of the survey for an overall response rate of 42.9\%. Respondents reported working a mean of 11.3 years in the psychiatric setting, being Board-Certified Music Therapists for 13.3 years, and working at their institution for 8.4 years. Most respondents (90.6\%) indicated they did not have a music therapist as a supervisor. Group music therapy was the dominant modality in psychiatric institutions for music therapists. Respondents indicated they read music therapy journals (80\%) and other types of psychiatric periodicals (57.1\%), presented educational sessions at conferences (44.6\%), conducted inservices for hospital staff (64.8\%), worked with an interdisciplinary treatment team (77.9\%), and trained practica students (43.5\%) and interns (37.4\%). Respondents also indicated that although most were not bilingual (85.7\%), they still worked with non-English speaking consumers (58.2\%). Participants noted that they enjoyed working with the psychiatric population and felt they had a positive influence on treatment as indicated by Likert-type scales. Respondents reported using primarily behavioral or psychodynamic approaches but considered their primary psychological philosophy as eclectic. Participants predominantly indicated they addressed goal areas such as socialization, communication, self-esteem, coping skills, and stress reduction/management. Participants noted they employed a variety of music therapy techniques such as music assisted relaxation, improvisation, songwriting, lyric analysis, and music and movement to address consumer objectives. Participants indicated they used therapeutic verbal skills and techniques such as humor, redirection, reinforcement, empathy, and affirmation in their clinical practice. Additionally, the results of this survey were compared to the psychiatric portion of a music therapy descriptive study published in 1979.

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate whether the outpatient, syndrome-based approach of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness ({IMCI}) protocol could be extended to the inpatient arena to give clear and simple minimum standards of care for poorly resourced facilities. Methods: A prospective, one-year admission cohort retrospectively compared hypothetical performance of syndrome-based management with paediatrician-defined final diagnosis. Admission syndrome definitions were based on local adaptations to the {IMCI} protocol that encompassed 20 clinical features, measurement of oxygen saturation, and malaria microscopy. Findings: After 315 children with clinically obvious diagnoses (e.g. sickle cell disease and burns) were excluded, 3705 admission episodes were studied. Of these, 2334 (63\%) met criteria for at least one severe syndrome (mortality 8\% vs {\textless}1\% for "non-severe" cases), and half of these had features of two or more severe syndromes. No cases of measles were seen. Syndrome-based treatment would have been appropriate (sensitivity {\textgreater}95\%) for severe pneumonia, severe malaria, and diarrhoea with severe dehydration, and probably for severe malnutrition (sensitivity 71\%). Syndrome-directed treatment suggested the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in 75/ 133 (56\% sensitivity) children with bacteraemic and 63/71 (89\% sensitivity) children with meningitis. Conclusions: Twenty clinical features, oxygen saturation measurements, and results of malaria blood slides could be used for inpatient, syndrome-based management of acute paediatric admissions. The addition of microscopy of the cerebrospinal fluid and haemoglobin measurements would improve syndrome-directed treatment considerably. This approach might rationalize admission policy and standardize inpatient paediatric care in resource-poor countries, although the clinical detection of bacteraemia remains a problem.},

In Ghana, where fertility levels vary considerably, demographic information at sub-national level is essential for building effective family planning programmes. We used small-area estimation techniques, linking data from the 2003 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey to the 2000 Ghana Population and Housing Census, to derive district-level estimates of contraceptive use and unmet need for contraception. The results show considerable variation between districts in contraceptive use and unmet need. The prevalence of contraceptive use varies from 4.1 to 41.7 per cent, while that of the use of modern methods varies from 4.0 to 34.8 per cent. The findings identify districts where family planning programmes need to be strengthened. © 2012 Copyright Population Investigation Committee.},

	abstract = {Background: The inclusion of Magnesium Sulphate ({MgSO}4) as a gold standard in the treatment of eclampsia has substantially reduced incidences of repeated fits, eclamptic morbidity and deaths. However, despite treatment with {MgSO}4, a proportion of patients need extra medical/nursing attention and prolonged stay in the intensive care unit ({ICU}). The literature on the underlying factors for the need of extra care in the {MgSO}4 era is lacking. This study sought to establish predictors of extra care in {ICU} among eclamptic patients after treatment with {MgSO}4 at Muhimbili National Hospital ({MNH}).Methods: Data were obtained from hospital records of eclamptic patients who were admitted at {MNH} and treated with {MgSO}4 from January 1st to December 31st, 2008. Based on set criteria, patients who needed extra care were identified. Analysis was performed using {PASW} statistics 18 whereby frequencies, cross-tabulations, bivariate and multiple logistic regressions were performed.Results: A total of 366 eclamptic patients were admitted and treated with {MgSO}4 at {MNH} during a 12 month study period in 2008. Most of these (76\%) were referred from district hospitals and132 (36\%) met the criteria for extra care in {ICU}. After adjusting for other variables, the risk of extra care in {ICU} for patients who were admitted with altered consciousness was double ({OR} = 2.3; 95\% {CI}: 1.3-4.0) that of the ones admitted in alert state. The risk or need of extra care increased by increasing time to delivery and was doubled ({OR} = 2.0; 95\% {CI}:1.1-3.7) if it was between 12 and 24 hours and tenfold elevated ({OR} = 10.0; 95\% {CI}:4.3-23.6) if beyond 24 hours as compared to when time to delivery was less than 12 hours.Abdominal delivery was also independently associated with increased risk compared to vaginal delivery ({OR} = 2.5; 95\%{CI}: 1.4-4.5). The type of referral and number of fits were associated with extra care in {ICU} but this association was wholly explained by the clinical status of the patient on admission to {MNH} and prolonged time lag to delivery.Conclusion: We concluded that even with {MgSO}4 used as the gold standard in the treatment of eclampsia, effective pre-referral care and expedited delivery were crucial in minimizing the need for extra care in {ICU}. © 2011 Muganyizi and Shagdara; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: A recent national survey in Tanzania reported that mortality in children younger than 5 years dropped by 24\% over the 5 years between 2000 and 2004. We aimed to investigate yearly changes to identify what might have contributed to this reduction and to investigate the prospects for meeting the Millennium Development Goal for child survival ({MDG} 4). Methods: We analysed data from the four demographic and health surveys done in Tanzania since 1990 to generate estimates of mortality in children younger than 5 years for every 1-year period before each survey back to 1990. We estimated trends in mortality between 1990 and 2004 by fitting Lowess regression, and forecasted trends in mortality in 2005 to 2015. We aimed to investigate contextual factors, whether part of Tanzania's health system or not, that could have affected child mortality. Findings: Disaggregated estimates of mortality showed a sharp acceleration in the reduction in mortality in children younger than 5 years in Tanzania between 2000 and 2004. In 1990, the point estimate of mortality was 141·5 (95\% {CI} 141·5-141·5) deaths per 1000 livebirths. This was reduced by 40\%, to reach a point estimate of 83·2 (95\% {CI} 70·1-96·3) deaths per 1000 livebirths in 2004. The change in absolute risk was 58·4 (95\% {CI} 32·7-83·8; p{\textless}0·0001). Between 1999 and 2004 we noted important improvements in Tanzania's health system, including doubled public expenditure on health; decentralisation and sector-wide basket funding; and increased coverage of key child-survival interventions, such as integrated management of childhood illness, insecticide-treated nets, vitamin A supplementation, immunisation, and exclusive breastfeeding. Other determinants of child survival that are not related to the health system did not change between 1999 and 2004, except for a slow increase in the {HIV}/{AIDS} burden. Interpretation: Tanzania could attain {MDG} 4 if this trend of improved child survival were to be sustained. Investment in health systems and scaling up interventions can produce rapid gains in child survival. Funding: Government of Norway. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the characteristics of the health labour force that can affect health care production is of critical importance to health planners and policymakers. This study uses health facility survey data to examine characteristics of the primary health care labour force in Nicaragua, Tanzania and Bangladesh. The characteristics examined are those that are likely to affect service provision, including urban/rural distribution, demographic characteristics, and experience and in-service training, for three types of providers (physicians, nurses and auxiliary nurses). The profiles suggest a pattern of urban/rural imbalances in Nicaragua and Tanzania. The Bangladesh facility survey did not include hospitals, thereby making concrete conclusions on the supply and distribution of providers difficult to make. Multivariate logistic regressions are used to assess the relationship between the urban/rural placement of providers by health need, population demand and facility characteristics. Health need, as measured by child mortality rates, does not have a significant association with the placement of providers in either country, unlike population size and annual growth rates. The mean number of years providers have worked at a facility is significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of rural placement for the three types of providers in Nicaragua. The mean age and percentage of female providers at each facility has a negative association with the placement of rural providers in Tanzania. The use of health facility data to profile the health care labour force is also discussed. © The Author 2006.

Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of provider data from a representative sample of Ghanaian health facilities in order to consider the determinants of {PAC} provision among both physicians and midwives. Results: In the previous 5 years, more than 58\% of providers had participated in at least one type of essential obstetric training. Overall, 28\% of clinicians were offering {PAC} services (80\% of physicians as compared to 20\% of midwives). Bivariately, the provision of {PAC} services was associated with in-service training. After adjusting for select provider and facility characteristics, {PAC}/{MVA} training, working in a facility with the National Reproductive Health Standards and Policy available, and not working in a publicly run facility were associated with midwives offering {PAC} services. Discussion: Although the provision of {PAC} by midwives is an efficient and cost-effective strategy for reducing maternal morbidity and mortality, clinical training of midwives leads to a lower yield of {PAC} providers when compared to physicians. Policy and practice should continue to support {PAC} expansion by trained midwives in the public sector and by understanding the barriers to provision of services by midwives working in public facilities. © 2010 American College of Nurse-Midwives.},

	abstract = {Background: Primary health care is essential in improving and maintaining the health of populations. It has the potential to accelerate achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and fulfill the " Health for All" doctrine of the Alma-Ata Declaration. Understanding the performance of the health system from a geographic perspective is important for improved health planning and evidence-based policy development. The aims of this study were to measure geographical accessibility, model spatial coverage of the existing primary health facility network, estimate the number of primary health facilities working under capacity and the population underserved in the Western Province of Rwanda.Methods: This study uses health facility, population and ancillary data for the Western Province of Rwanda. Three different travel scenarios utilized by the population to attend the nearest primary health facility were defined with a maximum travelling time of 60 minutes: Scenario 1 - walking; Scenario 2 - walking and cycling; and Scenario 3 - walking and public transportation. Considering these scenarios, a raster surface of travel time between primary health facilities and population was developed. To model spatial coverage and estimate the number of primary health facilities working under capacity, the catchment area of each facility was calculated by taking into account population coverage capacity, the population distribution, the terrain topography and the travelling modes through the different land categories.Results: Scenario 2 (walking and cycling) has the highest degree of geographical accessibility followed by Scenario 3 (walking and public transportation). The lowest level of accessibility can be observed in Scenario 1 (walking). The total population covered differs depending on the type of travel scenario. The existing primary health facility network covers only 26.6\% of the population in Scenario 1. In Scenario 2, the use of a bicycle greatly increases the population being served to 58\% of inhabitants. When considering Scenario 3, the total population served is 34.3\%.Conclusions: Significant spatial variations in geographical accessibility and spatial coverage were observed across the three travel scenarios. The analysis demonstrates that regardless of which travel scenario is used, the majority of the population in the Western Province does not have access to the existing primary health facility network. Our findings also demonstrate the usefulness of {GIS} methods to leverage multiple datasets from different sources in a spatial framework to provide support to evidence-based planning and resource allocation decision-making in developing countries. © 2012 Huerta Munoz and Källestål; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Neonatal deaths account for 40 of global under-five mortality and are ever more important if we are to achieve the Millennium Development Goal 4 ({MDG} 4) on child survival. We applied a results framework to evaluate global and national changes for neonatal mortality rates ({NMR}), healthy behaviours, intervention coverage, health system change, and inputs including funding, while considering contextual changes. The average annual rate of reduction of {NMR} globally accelerated between 2000 and 2010 (2.1 per year) compared with the 1990s, but was slower than the reduction in mortality of children aged 1-59 months (2.9 per year) and maternal mortality (4.2 per year). Regional variation of {NMR} change ranged from 3.0 per year in developed countries to 1.5 per year in sub-Saharan Africa. Some countries have made remarkable progress despite major challenges. Our statistical analysis identifies inter-country predictors of {NMR} reduction including high baseline {NMR}, and changes in income or fertility. Changes in intervention or package coverage did not appear to be important predictors in any region, but coverage data are lacking for several neonatal-specific interventions. Mortality due to neonatal infection deaths, notably tetanus, decreased, and deaths from complications of preterm birth are increasingly important. Official development assistance for maternal, newborn and child health doubled from 2003 to 2008, yet by 2008 only 6 of this aid mentioned newborns, and a mere 0.1 ({US}\$4.56m) exclusively targeted newborn care. The amount of newborn survival data and the evidence based increased, as did recognition in donor funding. Over this decade, {NMR} reduction seems more related to change in context, such as socio-economic factors, than to increasing intervention coverage. High impact cost-effective interventions hold great potential to save newborn lives especially in the highest burden countries. Accelerating progress requires data-driven investments and addressing context-specific implementation realities. © 2012 The Author.},

The objective of this paper is to identify the factors which influence the choice of place of delivery among the urban poor, with a distinction between sub-standard and "appropriate" health facilities. Methods: The data are from a maternal health project carried out in two slums of Nairobi, Kenya. A total of 1,927 women were interviewed, and 25 health facilities where they delivered, were assessed. Facilities were classified as either "inappropriate" or "appropriate". Place of delivery is the dependent variable. Ordered logit models were used to quantify the effects of covariates on the choice of place of delivery, defined as a three-category ordinal variable. Results: Although 70\% of women reported that they delivered in a health facility, only 48\% delivered in a facility with skilled attendant. Besides education and wealth, the main predictors of place of delivery included being advised during antenatal care to deliver at a health facility, pregnancy "wantedness", and parity. The influence of health promotion (i.e., being advised during antenatal care visits) was significantly higher among the poorest women. Conclusion: Interventions to improve the health of urban poor women should include improvements in the provision of, and access to, quality obstetric health services. Women should be encouraged to attend antenatal care where they can be given advice on delivery care and other pregnancy-related issues. Target groups should include poorest, less educated and higher parity women. © Springer Science+Business Media, {LLC} 2008.},

	abstract = {Objective: Even when initially successful, many interventions aimed at reducing the toll of water-related infectious disease have not been sustainable over longer periods of time. Here we review historical practices in water-related infectious disease research and propose an interdisciplinary public health-oriented systems approach to research and intervention design. Data Sources: On the basis of the literature and the author's experiences, we summarize contributions from key disciplines and identify common problems and trends. Practices in developing countries, where the disease burden is the most severe, are emphasized. Data Extraction: We define waterborne and water-associated vectorborne diseases and identify disciplinary themes and conceptual needs by drawing from ecologic, anthropologic, engineering, political/economic, and public health fields. A case study examines one of the classes of water-related infectious disease. Data Synthesis: The limited success in designing sustainable interventions is attributable to factors that include the complexity and interactions among the social, ecologic, engineering, political/ economic, and public health domains; incomplete data; a lack of relevant indicators; and most important, an inadequate understanding of the proximal and distal factors that cause water-related infectious disease. Fundamental change is needed for research on water-related infectious diseases, and we advocate a systems approach framework using an ongoing evidence-based health outcomes focus with an extended time horizon. The examples and case study in the review show many opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations, data fusion techniques, and other advances. Conclusions: The proposed framework will facilitate research by addressing the complexity and divergent scales of problems and by engaging scientists in the disciplines needed to tackle these difficult problems. Such research can enhance the prevention and control of water-related infectious diseases in a manner that is sustainable and focused on public health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Objective To determine how specific job attributes influenced fourth year medical students' stated preference for hypothetical rural job postings in Ghana. Methods Based on discussions with medical student focus groups and physicians in practice and in the Ministry of Health, we created a discrete choice experiment ({DCE}) that assessed how students' stated preference for certain rural postings was influenced by various job attributes: a higher salary, free superior housing, an educational allowance for children, improved equipment, supportive management, shorter contracts before study leave and a car. We conducted the {DCE} among all fourth year medical students in Ghana using a brief structured questionnaire and used mixed logit models to estimate the utility of each job attribute. Findings Complete data for {DCE} analysis were available for 302 of 310 (97\%) students. All attribute parameter estimates differed significantly from zero and had the expected signs. In the main effects mixed logit model, improved equipment and supportive management were most strongly associated with job preference (β = 1.42; 95\% confidence interval, {CI}: 1.17 to 1.66, and β = 1.17; 95\% {CI}: 0.96 to 1.39, respectively), although shorter contracts and salary bonuses were also associated. Discontinuing the provision of basic housing had a large negative influence (β = -1.59; 95\% {CI}: -1.88 to -1.31). In models including gender interaction terms, women's preferences were more influenced by supportive management and men's preferences by superior housing. Conclusion Better working conditions were strongly associated with the stated choice of hypothetical rural postings among fourth year Ghanaian medical students. Studies are needed to find out whether job attributes determine the actual uptake of rural jobs by graduating physicians.},

Using retrospective data from the 1998 and 2003 Demographic and Health Surveys, this paper investigates the extent of changes in spatial inequalities associated with type of delivery care in Ghana with a focus on rural-urban differentials within and across the three ecological zones (Savannah, Forest and Coastal). More than one-half of births in Ghana continue to occur outside health institutions without any skilled obstetric care. While this is already known, we present evidence from multilevel analyses that there exist considerable and growing inequalities, with regard to birth settings between communities, within rural and urban areas and across the ecological zones. The results show evidence of poor and disproportionate use of institutional care at birth; the inequalities remained high and unchanged in both urban and rural communities within the Savannah zone and widening in urban communities of the Forest and Coastal zones. The key policy challenges in Ghana, therefore, include both increasing the uptake of institutional delivery care and ensuring equity in access to both public and private health institutions. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, {LLC}.},

	abstract = {Context: Rwanda is the most densely populated country in Africa, with substantial annual population growth. The current government seeks new policies for family limitation as a way to facilitate more sustainable development. Methods: Data from the 2005 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey were used for a two-step analysis; binary logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with desiring to stop childbearing and having unmet need. Results: Eighty-seven percent of women aged 15-49 approve of family planning, but only 64\% believe that their partner approves of it. There is a high level of unmet need for family limitation; 58\% of women who want to stop childbearing do not use modern contraceptives. Demand was lower among women who did not approve of family planning, those who did not know their partner's attitude toward family planning and those who had discussed family planning with their partner fewer than three times. Unmet need was higher among women who did not approve of family planning, those who believed their partner did not approve of family planning or who did not know his attitude, and those who had never discussed family planning with their partner or had done so only once or twice. Conclusions: Negative attitudes toward family planning and failing structures of provision are the dominant constraints on the use of modern contraceptives in Rwanda. Community-based family planning services could greatly expand access, especially in underserved provinces.},

	abstract = {Remarkable progress over the last decade has put Bangladesh on track for Millennium Development Goal ({MDG}) 4 for child survival and achieved a 40 decline in maternal mortality. However, since neonatal deaths make up 57 of under-five mortality in the country, increased scale up and equity in programmes for neonatal survival are critical to sustain progress. We examined change for newborn survival from 2000 to 2010 considering mortality, coverage and funding indicators, as well as contextual factors. The national neonatal mortality rate has undergone an annual decline of 4.0 since 2000, reflecting greater progress than both the regional and global averages, but the mortality reduction for children 1-59 months was double this rate, at 8.6. Examining policy and programme change, and national and donor funding for health, we identified various factors which contributed to an environment favourable to newborn survival. Locally-generated evidence combined with re-packaged global evidence, notably The Lancet Neonatal Series, has played a role, although pathways between research and policies and programme change are often complex. Several high-profile champions have had major influence. Attention for community initiatives and considerable donor funding also appear to have contributed. There have been some increases in coverage of key interventions, such as skilled attendance at birth and postnatal care, however these are low and reach less than one-third of families. Major reductions in total fertility, some change in gross national income and other contextual factors are likely to also have had an influence in mortality reduction. However, other factors such as socio-economic and geographic inequalities, frequent changes in government and pluralistic implementation structures have provided challenges. As coverage of health services increases, a notable gap remains in quality of facility-based care. Future gains for newborn survival in Bangladesh rest upon increased implementation at scale and greater consistency in content and quality of programmes and services. © 2012 The Author.},

This article uses small area estimation techniques to derive model-based district-level estimates of institutional births in Ghana by linking data from the 2003 {GDHS} and the 2000 Population and Housing Census. The models indicate considerable variability in the estimates, with institutional births ranging between 7\% and 27\% in the districts of the Northern region, compared to 78\% and 85\% in the districts of the Greater Accra Region. The diagnostic measures indicate that the model-based estimates are reliable and representative of the district to which they belong.},

A descriptive cross-sectional survey. Setting: Kisumu Municipal Health facilities. Subjects: Four hundred and eighty two mothers were interviewed in a household survey. Results: A total of 482 mothers were interviewed in the household survey. Out of these, only 40.4\%, 53.7\% and 45.7\% had respectively used Municipal facilities for antenatal services ({ANC}), immunisation and treatment of their children the last time they required such a service. This translates to by-pass rates for Municipal health facilities of 59.5\%, 46.3\% and 54.3\% respectively for the three services. By-pass was higher for the more central urban catchment areas than the more peripheral ones, a finding that was associated with the socio-economic status of the respondents and the relative location of the municipal facilities vis-a-vis competing facilities, mainly the District and Provincial hospitals. The main reasons cited for by-pass were poor care (21\%), lack of drugs and supplies (17\%) and lack of/poor laboratory services (12\%). From the facility audit, most of the clinics had a reasonable capacity to offer basic health care with only three scoring less than 50\% in the scale used. The worst areas were in availability of drugs, equipment and management issues. There was a strong relationship between the perceived quality of care and utilisation of {MCH} services as well as by-pass. The capacity of the facilities to offer care was however not associated with utilisation of {MCH} services or by-pass. Conclusion: There is under-utilisation of Municipal health facilities for {MCH} services. This is related to the perceived poor quality of care in the facilities. Perception of quality is influenced by a person's socio-economic status especially education.},

	abstract = {Background. When replacing failing drugs for malaria with more effective drugs, an important step towards reducing the malaria burden is that health workers ({HW}) prescribe drugs according to evidence-based guidelines. Past studies have shown that {HW} commonly do not follow guidelines, yet few studies have explored with appropriate methods why such practices occur. Methods. We analysed data from a survey of government health facilities in four Kenyan districts in which {HW} consultations were observed, caretakers and {HW} were interviewed, and health facility assessments were performed. The analysis was limited to children 2-59 months old with uncomplicated malaria. Treatment was defined as recommended (antimalarial recommended by national guidelines), a minor error (effective, but non-recommended antimalarial), or inappropriate (no effective antimalarial). Results. We evaluated 1006 consultations performed by 135 {HW} at 81 facilities: 567 children received recommended treatment, 314 had minor errors, and 125 received inappropriate treatment (weighted percentages: 56.9\%, 30.4\%, and 12.7\%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that programmatic interventions such as in-service malaria training, provision of guidelines and wall charts, and more frequent supervision were significantly associated with better treatment quality. However, neither in-service training nor possession of the guideline document showed an effect by itself. More qualified {HW} made more errors: both major and minor errors (but generally more minor errors) when second-line drugs were in stock, and more major errors when second-line drugs were not in stock. Child factors such as age and a main complaint of fever were also associated with treatment quality. Conclusions. Our results support the use of several programmatic strategies that can redress {HW} deficiencies in malaria treatment. Targeted cost-effectiveness trials would help refine these strategies and provide more precise guidance on affordable and effective ways to strengthen and maintain {HW} practices. © International Epidemiological Association 2004; all rights reserved.},

In a setting of persistently high fertility rates, a crisis in human resources for health and a recent history of civil unrest, Uganda has prioritized Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 for child and maternal survival. As part of a multi-country analysis we examined change for newborn survival over the past decade through mortality and health system coverage indicators as well as national and donor funding for health, and policy and programme change. Between 2000 and 2010 Uganda's neonatal mortality rate reduced by 2.2 per year, which is greater than the regional average rate of decline but slower than national reductions in maternal mortality and under-five mortality after the neonatal period. While existing population-based data are insufficient to measure national changes in coverage and quality of services, national attention for maternal and child health has been clear and authorized from the highest levels. Attention and policy change for newborn health is comparatively recent. This recognized gap has led to a specific focus on newborn health through a national Newborn Steering Committee, which has been given a mandate from the Ministry of Health to advise on newborn survival issues since 2006. This multi-disciplinary and inter-agency network of stakeholders has been able to preside over a number of important policy changes at the level of facility care, education and training, community-based service delivery through Village Health Teams and changes to essential drugs and commodities. The committee's comprehensive reach has enabled rapid policy change and increased attention to newborn survival in a relatively short space of time. Translating this favourable policy environment into district-level implementation and high quality services is now the priority. © 2012 The Author.},

	abstract = {Background: The concept of continuum of care has recently been highlighted as a core principle of maternal, newborn and child health initiatives, and as a means to save lives. However, evidence has consistently revealed that access to care during and post delivery (intra and postpartum) remains a challenge in the continuum of care framework. In places where skilled delivery assistance is exclusively available in health facilities, access to health facilities is critical to the survival of the mother and her newborn. However, little is known about the association of place of delivery and survival of neonates. This paper uses longitudinal data generated in a Health and Demographic Surveillance System in rural Southern Tanzania to assess associations of neonatal mortality and place of delivery.Methods: Three cohorts of singleton births (born 2005, 2006 and 2007) were each followed up from birth to 28 days. Place of birth was classified as either "health facility" or "community". Neonatal mortality rates were produced for each year and by place of birth. Poisson regression was used to estimate crude relative risks of neonatal death by place of birth. Adjusted ratios were derived by controlling for maternal age, birth order, maternal schooling, sex of the child and wealth status of the maternal household.Results: Neonatal mortality for health facility singleton deliveries in 2005 was 32.3 per 1000 live births while for those born in the community it was 29.7 per 1000 live births. In 2006, neonatal mortality rates were 28.9 and 26.9 per 1,000 live births for deliveries in health facilities and in the community respectively. In 2007 neonatal mortality rates were 33.2 and 27.0 per 1,000 live births for those born in health facilities and in the community respectively. Neonates born in a health facility had similar chances of dying as those born in the community in all the three years of study. Adjusted relative risks ({ARR}) for neonatal death born in a health facility in 2005, 2006 and 2007 were 0.99 (95\%{CI}: 0.58 - 1.70), 0.98 (95\%{CI}: 0.62 - 1.54) and 1.18 (95\% {CI}: 0.76 - 1.85) respectively.Conclusions: We found no evidence to suggest that delivery in health facilities was associated with better survival chances of the neonates. © 2012 Nathan and Mwanyangala; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

Method. A systematic literature review was carried out. Electronic searches were performed in Pubmed, Embase, {PsycINFO}, {CINAHL} and {SSCI}. Qualitative content analysis of statements about {PF} was conducted using inductive coding. Results. The searches yielded 353 citations, 79 papers were eligible for analyses. Five hundred thirty-eight statements about {PF} were extracted, condensed and coded. Beside conceptual statements, 238 examples of potential {PF} as well as five attempts at classifying {PF} were found in the literature. {PF} were considered in relation to clinical service provision, assessment and intervention, in research and social security contexts. {PF} were seen to be related to various aspects of health, functioning, disability and the environment. Conclusions. The analysis of the literature shows that {PF} is seen as relevant to the application of the {ICF} in various settings. The review revealed a need for standardisation of {PF}.

	abstract = {Some countries (e.g. Brazil) have good reputations on {AIDS} policy, whereas others, (notably South Africa) have been criticized for inadequate leadership. Cross-country regression analysis reveals that these 'poster children' for {AIDS} leadership have indeed performed better or worse than expected given their economic and institutional constraints and the demographic and health challenges facing them. Regressions were run on {HAART} coverage (number on highly active antiretroviral therapy as percentage of total need) and {MTCTP} coverage (pregnant {HIV}+ women accessing mother-to-child-transmission prevention services as percentage of total need). Brazil, Cambodia, Thailand and Uganda (all of whom have established reputations for good leadership on {AIDS} performed consistently better than expected - as did Burkina-Faso, Suriname, Paraguay Costa Rica, Mali and Namibia. South Africa, which has the worst reputation for {AIDS} leadership, performed significantly below expectations - as did Uruguay and Trinidad and Tobago. The paper thus confirms much of the conventional wisdom on {AIDS} leadership at country level and suggests new areas for research. © The Author 2008, Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Faculty of Public Health.

	abstract = {Background: As part of efforts to reduce maternal deaths in Nigeria, pregnant women are being encouraged to give birth in healthcare facilities. However, little is known about whether or not available healthcare facilities can cope with an increasing demand for obstetric care. We thus carried out this survey as a rapid and tactical assessment of facility quality. We visited 121 healthcare facilities, and used the opportunity to interview over 700 women seeking care at these facilities. Findings: Most of the primary healthcare facilities we visited were unable to provide all basic Emergency Obstetric Care ({bEmOC}) services. In general, they lack clinical staff needed to dispense maternal and neonatal care services, ambulances and uninterrupted electricity supply whenever there were obstetric emergencies. Secondary healthcare facilities fared better, but, like their primary counterparts, lack neonatal care infrastructure. Among patients, most lived within 30 minutes of the visited facilities and still reported some difficulty getting there. Of those who had had two or more childbirths, the conditional probability of a delivery occurring in a healthcare facility was 0.91 if the previous delivery occurred in a healthcare facility, and 0.24 if it occurred at home. The crude risk of an adverse neonatal outcome did not significantly vary by delivery site or birth attendant, and the occurrence of such an outcome during an in-facility delivery may influence the mother to have her next delivery outside. Such an outcome during a home delivery may not prompt a subsequent in-facility delivery. Conclusions: In conclusion, reducing maternal deaths in Nigeria will require attention to both increasing the number of facilities with high-quality {EmOC} capability and also assuring Nigerian women have access to these facilities regardless of where they live. © 2012 Erim et al.},

	abstract = {Background: The World Health Organization ({WHO}) recommended physician to population ratio is 23:10,000. Kenya has a physician to population ratio of 1.8:10,000 and is among 57 countries listed as having a serious shortage of health workers. Approximately 52 \% of physicians work in urban areas, 6 \% in rural and 42 \% in peri-urban locations. This study explored factors influencing the choice of career specialization and location for practice among final year medical students by gender. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out on final year students in 2013 at the University of Nairobi's, School of Medicine in Kenya. Sample size was calculated at 156 students for simple random sampling. Data collected using a pre-tested self-administered questionnaire included socio-demographic characteristics of the population, first and second choices for specialization. Outcome variables collected were factors affecting choice of specialty and location for practice. Bivariate analysis by gender was carried out between the listed factors and outcome variables with calculation of odds ratios and chi-square statistics at an alpha level of significance of 0.05. Factors included in a binomial logistic regression model were analysed to score the independent categorical variables affecting choice of specialty and location of practice. Results: Internal medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynaecology and Paediatrics accounted for 58.7 \% of all choices of specialization. Female students were less likely to select Obs/Gyn ({OR} 0.41, 95 \% {CI} =0.17-0.99) and Surgery ({OR} 0.33, 95 \% {CI} = 0.13-0.86) but eight times more likely to select Paediatrics ({OR} 8.67, 95 \% {CI} = 1.91-39.30). Surgery was primarily selected because of the 'perceived prestige of the specialty' ({OR} 4.3 95 \% {CI} = 1.35-14.1). Paediatrics was selected due to 'Ease of raising a family' ({OR} 4.08 95 \% {CI} = 1.08-15.4). Rural origin increased the odds of practicing in a rural area ({OR} 2.5, 95 \% {CI} = 1.04-6.04). Training abroad was more likely to result in preference for working abroad ({OR} 9.27 95 \% {CI} = 2.1-41.9). Conclusions: The 4 core specialties predominate as career preferences. Females are more likely to select career choices due to 'ease of raising a family'. Rural origin of students was found to be the most important factor for retention of rural health workforce. This data can be used to design prospective cohort studies in an effort to understand the dynamic influence that governments, educational institutions, work environments, family and friends exert on medical students' careers. © 2016 Dossajee et al.},

	abstract = {Promotion of family planning in countries with high birth rates has the potential to reduce poverty and hunger and avert 32\% of all maternal deaths and nearly 10\% of childhood deaths. It would also contribute substantially to women's empowerment, achievement of universal primary schooling, and long-term environmental sustainability. In the past 40 years, family-planning programmes have played a major part in raising the prevalence of contraceptive practice from less than 10\% to 60\% and reducing fertility in developing countries from six to about three births per woman. However, in half the 75 larger low-income and lower-middle income countries (mainly in Africa), contraceptive practice remains low and fertility, population growth, and unmet need for family planning are high. The cross-cutting contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals makes greater investment in family planning in these countries compelling. Despite the size of this unfinished agenda, international funding and promotion of family planning has waned in the past decade. A revitalisation of the agenda is urgently needed. Historically, the {USA} has taken the lead but other governments or agencies are now needed as champions. Based on the sizeable experience of past decades, the key features of effective programmes are clearly established. Most governments of poor countries already have appropriate population and family-planning policies but are receiving too little international encouragement and funding to implement them with vigour. What is currently missing is political willingness to incorporate family planning into the development arena. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Uganda is proposing introduction of the National Health Insurance scheme ({NHIS}) in a phased manner with the view to obtaining additional funding for the health sector and promoting financial risk protection. In this paper, we have assessed the proposed {NHIS} from an equity perspective, exploring the extent to which {NHIS} would improve existing disparities in the health sector. Methods: We reviewed the proposed design and other relevant documents that enhanced our understanding of contextual issues. We used the Kutzin and fair financing frameworks to critically assess the impact of {NHIS} on overall equity in financing in Uganda. Results: The introduction of {NHIS} is being proposed against the backdrop of inequalities in the distribution of health system inputs between rural and urban areas, different levels of care and geographic areas. In this assessment, we find that gradual implementation of {NHIS} will result in low coverage initially, which might pose a challenge for effective management of the scheme. The process for accreditation of service providers during the first phase is not explicit on how it will ensure that a two-tier service provision arrangement does not emerge to cater for different types of patients. If the proposed fee-for-service mechanism of reimbursing providers is pursued, utilisation patterns will determine how resources are allocated. This implies that equity in resource allocation will be determined by the distribution of accredited providers, and checks put in place to prohibit frivolous use. The current design does not explicitly mention how these two issues will be tackled. Lastly, there is no clarity on how the {NHIS} will fit into, and integrate within existing financing mechanisms. Conclusion: Under the current {NHIS} design, the initial low coverage in the first years will inhibit optimal achievement of the important equity characteristics of pooling, cross-subsidisation and financial protection. Depending on the distribution of accredited providers and utilisation patterns, the {NHIS} could worsen existing disparities in access to services, given the fee-for-service reimbursement mechanisms currently proposed. Lastly, if equity in financing and resource allocation are not explicit objectives of the {NHIS}, it might inadvertently worsen the existing disparities in service provision. © 2010 Orem and Zikusooka; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

In 2009, only about 34\% of those in need of antiretroviral treatment ({ART}) were able to access care, which means that Nigeria was far from achieving the United Nations target of 'universal access' by 2010. This study aimed to describe the barriers to accessibility and the coping strategies employed to overcome these barriers among users of free {ART} services overall and by socioeconomic status ({SES}). Data were collected from 240 people receiving {ART} at one urban and one peri-urban health facility in Enugu State, south-eastern Nigeria. Information on {SES}, demographic characteristics, and barriers and coping mechanisms for accessing {ART} were elicited from the respondents. The high cost of transportation, {HIV} stigma, and long waiting hours were found to be key barriers to the use of {ART} services. On average, {ART} clients spent just under four hours at the clinic during their monthly appointments. The use of personal savings and financial support from relatives were the main means to access treatment. When the data were analysed according to clients' {SES}, transportation costs were a chief concern among the poorest while those who were better off were more likely to be concerned about stigma and discrimination.

	abstract = {Background: Integration of {HIV} into {RMNCH} (reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health) services is an important process addressing the disproportionate burden of {HIV} among mothers and children in sub-Saharan Africa. We assess the structural inputs and processes of care that support {HIV} testing and counselling in routine antenatal care to understand supply-side dynamics critical to scaling up further integration of {HIV} into {RMNCH} services prior to recent changes in {HIV} policy in Tanzania. Methods: This study, as a part of a maternal and newborn health program evaluation in Morogoro Region, Tanzania, drew from an assessment of health centers with 18 facility checklists, 65 quantitative and 57 qualitative provider interviews, and 203 antenatal care observations. Descriptive analyses were performed with quantitative data using Stata 12.0, and qualitative data were analyzed thematically with data managed by Atlas.ti. Results: Limitations in structural inputs, such as infrastructure, supplies, and staffing, constrain the potential for integration of {HIV} testing and counselling into routine antenatal care services. While assessment of infrastructure, including waiting areas, appeared adequate, long queues and small rooms made private and confidential {HIV} testing and counselling difficult for individual women. Unreliable stocks of {HIV} test kits, essential medicines, and infection prevention equipment also had implications for provider-patient relationships, with reported decreases in women's care seeking at health centers. In addition, low staffing levels were reported to increase workloads and lower motivation for health workers. Despite adequate knowledge of counselling messages, antenatal counselling sessions were brief with incomplete messages conveyed to pregnant women. In addition, coping mechanisms, such as scheduling of clinical activities on different days, limited service availability. Conclusion: Antenatal care is a strategic entry point for the delivery of critical tests and counselling messages and the framing of patient-provider relations, which together underpin care seeking for the remaining continuum of care. Supplyside deficiencies in structural inputs and processes of delivering {HIV} testing and counselling during antenatal care indicate critical shortcomings in the quality of care provided. These must be addressed if integrating {HIV} testing and counselling into antenatal care is to result in improved maternal and newborn health outcomes. © 2015 An et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Interventions to reduce maternal mortality have focused on delivery in facilities, yet in many low-resource settings rates of facility-based birth have remained persistently low. In Tanzania, rates of facility delivery have remained static for more than 20 years. With an aim to advance research and inform policy changes, this paper builds on a growing body of work that explores dimensions of and responses to disrespectful maternity care and abuse during childbirth in facilities across Morogoro Region, Tanzania. Methods: This research drew on in-depth interviews with 112 respondents including women who delivered in the preceding 14 months, their male partners, public opinion leaders and community health workers to understand experiences with and responses to abuse during childbirth. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated and coded using Atlas.ti. Analysis drew on the principles of Grounded Theory. Results: When initially describing birth experiences, women portrayed encounters with providers in a neutral or satisfactory light. Upon probing, women recounted events or circumstances that are described as abusive in maternal health literature: feeling ignored or neglected; monetary demands or discriminatory treatment; verbal abuse; and in rare instances physical abuse. Findings were consistent across respondent groups and districts. As a response to abuse, women described acquiescence or non-confrontational strategies: resigning oneself to abuse, returning home, or bypassing certain facilities or providers. Male respondents described more assertive approaches: requesting better care, paying a bribe, lodging a complaint and in one case assaulting a provider. Conclusions: Many Tanzanian women included in this study experienced unfavorable conditions when delivering in facilities. Providers, women and their families must be made aware of women's rights to respectful care. Recommendations for further research include investigations of the prevalence and dimensions of disrespectful care and abuse, on mechanisms for women and their families to effectively report and redress such events and on interventions that could mitigate neglect or isolation among delivering women.

We accomplish this by linking the Malawi Schooling and Adolescent Study, a longitudinal survey of young people, with the Malawi Service Provision Assessment collected in 2013–14. We also identify factors that determine choice of facility among those who use contraception. We find that the presence and characteristics of nearby facilities with contraception available did not appear to affect use. Rather, characteristics such as facility type and whether contraception was provided free of charge determined where women deciding to use contraception obtained their contraception. We argue that in a context where almost all respondents resided within 10 kilometers of a health facility, improving access to and quality of family-planning services may not markedly increase contraceptive use among young women without broader shifts in norms regarding childbearing in the early years of marriage. © 2017, © 2017 by The American Academy of Political and Social Science.},

Monitoring and evaluation efforts in this area can take advantage of large nationally representative household surveys such as {DHS} or {MICS} that are increasing in size and frequency, however, this analysis presents challenges on several fronts. We propose an approach with hierarchical models for cross-sectional survey data to describe evidence relating to program evaluation, and apply this approach to the recent scale up of {iCCM} in Malawi. We describe careseeking for children sick with diarrhea, pneumonia, or malaria with empirical Bayes estimates for each district of Malawi at two time points, both for careseeking from any source, and for careseeking only from health surveillance assistants ({HSA}). We do not find evidence that children in areas with more {HSA} trained in {iCCM} are more likely to seek care for pneumonia, diarrhea, or malaria, despite evidence that many indeed are seeking care from {HSA}. Children in areas with more {HSA} trained in {iCCM} are more likely to seek care from a {HSA}, with 100 additional trained health workers in a district corresponding to a 2\% average increase in careseeking from {HSA}. The hierarchical models presented here provide a flexible set of methods that describe the primary evidence for evaluating {iCCM} in Malawi and which could be extended to formal causal analyses, and to analysis for other similar evaluations with national survey data. © 2016 Perin et al.

	abstract = {Background: Thousands of women and newborns still die preventable deaths from pregnancy and childbirth-related complications in poor settings. Delivery with a skilled birth attendant is a vital intervention for saving lives. Yet many women, particularly where maternal mortality ratios are highest, do not have a skilled birth attendant at delivery. In Uganda, only 58\% of women deliver in a health facility, despite approximately 95\% of women attending antenatal care ({ANC}). This study aimed to (1) identify key factors underlying the gap between high rates of antenatal care attendance and much lower rates of health-facility delivery; (2) examine the association between advice during antenatal care to deliver at a health facility and actual place of delivery; (3) investigate whether antenatal care services in a post-conflict district of Northern Uganda actively link women to skilled birth attendant services; and (4) make recommendations for policy- and program-relevant implementation research to enhance use of skilled birth attendance services. Methods: This study was carried out in Gulu District in 2009. Quantitative and qualitative methods used included: structured antenatal care client entry and exit interviews [n = 139]; semi-structured interviews with women in their homes [n = 36], with health workers [n = 10], and with policymakers [n = 10]; and focus group discussions with women [n = 20], men [n = 20], and traditional birth attendants [n = 20]. Results: Seventy-five percent of antenatal care clients currently pregnant reported they received advice during their last pregnancy to deliver in a health facility, and 58\% of these reported having delivered in a health facility. After adjustment for confounding, women who reported they received advice at antenatal care to deliver at a health facility were significantly more likely ({aOR} = 2.83 [95\% {CI}: 1.19-6.75], p = 0.02) to report giving birth in a facility. Despite high antenatal care coverage, a number of demand and supply side barriers deter use of skilled birth attendance services. Primary barriers were: fear of being neglected or maltreated by health workers; long distance and other difficulties in access; poverty, and material requirements for delivery; lack of support from husband/partner; health systems deficiencies such as inadequate staffing/training, work environment, and referral systems; and socio-cultural and gender issues such as preferred birthing position and preference for traditional birth attendants. Conclusions: Initiatives to improve quality of client-provider interaction and respect for women are essential. Financial barriers must be abolished and emergency transport for referrals improved. Simultaneously, supply-side barriers must be addressed, notably ensuring a sufficient number of health workers providing skilled obstetric care in health facilities and creating habitable conditions and enabling environments for them. © 2015 Anastasi et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Malaria rapid diagnostic tests ({RDTs}) have great potential to improve quality care and rational drug use in malaria-endemic settings although studies have shown common {RDT} non-compliance. Yet, evidence has largely been derived from limited hospital settings in few countries. This article reviews a {PhD} thesis that analyzed national surveys from multiple sub-Saharan African countries to generate large-scale evidence of malaria diagnosis practices and its determinants across different contexts. Design: A mixed-methods approach was used across four studies that included quantitative analysis of national household and facility surveys conducted in multiple sub-Saharan African countries at the outset of new guidelines (Demographic and Health Surveys and Service Provision Assessments). Qualitative methods were used to explore reasons for quantitative findings in select settings. Results: There was low (17\%) and inequitable test uptake across 13 countries in 2009-2011/12, with greater testing at hospitals than at peripheral clinics (odds ratio [{OR}]: 0.62, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 0.56-0.69) or community health workers ({OR}: 0.31, 95\% {CI}: 0.23-0.43) (Study I). Significant variation was found in the effect of diagnosis on antimalarial use at the population level across countries (Uganda {OR}: 0.84, 95\% {CI}: 0.66-1.06; Mozambique {OR}: 3.54, 95\% {CI}: 2.33-5.39) (Study {II}). A Malawi national facility census indicated common compliance to malaria treatment guidelines (85\% clients with {RDT}-confirmed malaria prescribed first-line treatment), although other fever assessments were not often conducted and there was poor antibiotic targeting (59\% clients inappropriately prescribed antibiotics). {RDT}-negative patients had 16.8 (95\% {CI}: 8.6- 32.7) times higher odds of antibiotic overtreatment than {RDT}-positive patients conditioned by cough or difficult breathing complaints (Study {III}). In Mbarara (Uganda), health workers reportedly prescribed antimalarials to {RDT}-negative patients if no other fever cause was identified and non-compliance seemed further driven by {RDT} perceptions, system constraints, and client interactions (Study {IV}). Conclusions: A shift from malaria-focused test and treat strategies toward {IMCI} with testing is needed to improve quality care and rational use of both antimalarial and antibiotic medicines. Strengthened health systems are also needed to support quality clinical care, including adherence to malaria test results, and {RDT} deployment should be viewed as a unique opportunity to contribute to these important efforts. © 2016 Emily White Johansson.},

	abstract = {Background: Maternal and Child Health ({MCH}) Handbook, an integrated {MCH} home-based record, was piloted in four provinces of Vietnam (Dien Bien, Hoa Binh, Thanh Hoa and An Giang). The study is aimed at assessing the changes in pregnant women's behavior towards the frequencies of their antenatal care service utilizations and their subsequent breastfeeding practices up to six months of age, through the {MCH} Handbook intervention. This is because the levels of pregnant women's knowledge, attitude and practices ({KAP}) towards their antenatal care service utilizations and exclusive breastfeeding practices have been previously neither analyzed nor reported in relation to {MCH} home-based records in the country. Methods: To compare pre-intervention baseline in 2011, post-intervention data were collected in 2013. Structured interviews were conducted with randomly selected 810 mothers of children 6-18 months of age in the four provinces. A focus group discussion among mothers in each of four provinces was conducted. Results: There was no significant difference in pregnant women's knowledge about the need for ≥3 antenatal care visits between pre- and post-interventions. Yet, the proportion of pregnant women who made ≥3 antenatal care visits in post-intervention was significantly higher than in pre-intervention. Thus, {MCH} Handbook is likely to have contributed to practicing ≥3 antenatal care visits, by changing their attitude. The proportion of mothers who know the need for exclusive breastfeeding necessary during the initial six months significantly increased between pre- and post-interventions. The proportion of those practicing exclusive breastfeeding significantly increased between pre- and post-interventions, too. Thus, {MCH} Handbook is likely to have contributed to the increase in both knowledge about and practices of exclusive breastfeeding. Conclusion: The results of study imply that {MCH} Handbook contributed to the increase in pregnant women's practices of ≥3 antenatal care visits and in their knowledge about and practice of exclusive breastfeeding. While there is room for improvement in the level of its data recording, the study confirmed that {MCH} Handbook plays a catalytic role in ensuring a continuum of maternal, newborn and child care. Note that this study is the first study that attempted to estimate pregnant women's behavioral changes through {MCH} Handbook intervention in Vietnam. © 2016 Aiga et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Patients' reported opinions of the health system need to be understood in order to provide patient-centered care. We investigated determinants of women's ratings of the quality of care during their most recent facility delivery. Methods: We conducted a census of all deliveries in the 6 weeks to 12 months preceding the survey, in villages served by 24 primary care clinics in rural Pwani Region, Tanzania. Women who had delivered children in a study facility were included in this analysis (n = 855). We interviewed women about demographic and obstetric factors and the quality of their obstetric care using a structured questionnaire. We created a composite index of perceived quality from six quality questions. We also assessed the functioning of the local health clinic using structured surveys. We used a multi-level model to analyze factors associated with women's rating of the quality of care during delivery. Results: 14\% of respondents rated the overall quality of care received during delivery as excellent. Women who listened to the radio daily reported lower quality composite scores (β: -0.99, p {\textless} 0.001). Women who reported receiving more services in {ANC} had higher quality scores (β: 0.46, p = 0.001), as did women receiving more delivery services (β: 0.55, p {\textless} 0.001). Women who reported disrespect and abuse during delivery had significantly lower quality scores (β: -4.13, p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: A woman's expectations and prior and current experiences influence her perception of the quality of care she received. Health facility characteristics did not influence ratings of overall quality. Focusing on improving the process rather than inputs of service delivery during {ANC} visits and delivery may increase perceived quality of delivery care in low-resource settings. © 2014 Larson et al.},

	abstract = {Background Currently many measures of intervention coverage obtained from household surveys do not measure actual health intervention/ service delivery, resulting in a need for linking reports of care-seeking with assessments of the service environment in order to improve measurements. This systematic review aims to identify evidence of different methods used to link household surveys and service provision assessments, with a focus on reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health care, in low- and middle-income countries. Methods Using pre-defined search terms, articles published in peer- reviewed journals and the grey literature after 1990 were identified, their reference lists scanned and linking methods synthesized. Findings A total of 59 articles and conference presentations were carefully reviewed and categorized into two groups based on the linking method used: 1) indirect/ecological linking that included studies in which health care-seeking behavior was linked to all or the nearest facilities or providers of certain types within a geographical area, and 2) direct linking/exact matching where individuals were linked with the exact provider or facility where they sought care. The former approach was employed in 51 of 59 included studies, and was particularly common among studies that were based on independent sources of household and facility data that were nationally representative. Only eight of the 59 reviewed studies employed direct linking methods, which were typically done at the sub-national level (eg, district level) and often in rural areas, where the number of providers was more limited compared to urban areas. Conclusions Different linking methods have been reported in the literature, each category has its own set of advantages and limitations, in terms of both methodology and practicality for scale-up. Future studies that link household and provider/facility data should also take into account factors such as sources of data, the timing of surveys, the temporality of data points, the type of services and interventions, and the scale of the study in order to produce valid and reliable results.},

	abstract = {Aim This paper aims to identify factors that systematically predict why some countries that have tried to scale up oral rehydration solution ({ORS}) have succeeded, and others have not. Methods We examined {ORS} coverage over time, across countries, and through case studies. We conducted expert interviews and literature and data searches to better understand the history of {ORS} scale-up efforts and why they failed or succeeded in nine countries. We used qualitative, pairwise (or three-country) comparisons of geographically or otherwise similar countries that had different outcomes in terms of {ORS} scale-up. An algorithm was developed which scored country performance across key supply, demand and financing activities to quantitatively assess the scale-up efforts in each country. Results The vast majority of countries have neither particularly low nor encouragingly high {ORS} use rates. We observed three clearly identifiable contrasts between countries that achieved and sustained high {ORS} coverage and those that did not. Key partners across sectors have critical roles to play to effectively address supply- and demand- side barriers. Efforts must synchronize demand generation, private provider outreach and public sector work. Many donor funds are either suspended or redirected in the event of political instability, exacerbating the health challenges faced by countries in these contexts. We found little information on the cost of scale-up efforts. Conclusions We identified a number of characteristics of successful {ORS} scale-up programs, including involvement of a broad range of key players, addressing supply and demand generation together, and working with both public and private sectors. Dedicated efforts are needed to launch and sustain success, including monitoring and evaluation plans to track program costs and impacts. These case studies were designed to inform programmatic decision-making; thus, rigorous academic methods to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate country {ORS} scale-up programs might yield additional, critical insights and confirm our conclusions. © 2013 Journal of Global Health.},

This study investigates whether receipt of social support in addition to {ART} for {PLWHA} makes the households that they reside in better off than households that have {PLWHA} but are without social support. The analysis uses data comprising of 450 households, which is a sub-sample from the 2010/2011 Centre for Health Economics Ugandan {HIV} Survey, a cross-sectional survey of 596 households that was undertaken in Uganda. Data were collected from households of clients that obtained {ART} from two major {ART} service providers in Central Uganda; The {AIDS} Support Organisation ({TASO}) and Ministry of Health ({MOH}), Uganda. Probit models and ordinary least squares regressions are employed to compare outcomes for individuals from households with a {TASO} or {MOH} client. Outcomes for individuals in households with a {TASO} {PLWHA} are hypothesised to be superior to those from households with an {MOH} {PLWHA} given that the benefits from social support accrue not only to the {PLWHA} but also to the household and communities they belong to. The results confirm that individuals from a household with a {TASO} {PLWHA} are better off in terms of physical health outcomes including better productivity as non-wage labour hours and having more cash in hand and having savings. The findings highlight the importance of additional support to {HIV}/{AIDS} clients and have implications for supplementation of {ART} service provision with other services to maximise the benefits from {ART} in resource constrained countries like Uganda. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, {LLC}.},

	abstract = {Background: The efforts and commitments to accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals for maternal and newborn health ({MDGs} 4 and 5) in low and middle income countries have focused primarily on providing key medical interventions at maternity facilities to save the lives of women at the time of childbirth, as well as their babies. However, in most rural communities in sub-Saharan, access to maternal and newborn care services is still limited and even where services are available they often lack the infrastructural prerequisites to function at the very basic level in providing essential routine health care services, let alone emergency care. Lists of essential interventions for normal and complicated childbirth, do not take into account these prerequisites, thus the needs of most health facilities in rural communities are ignored, although there is enough evidence that maternal and newborn deaths continue to remain unacceptably high in these areas. Methods: This study uses data gathered through qualitative interviews in Kitonyoni and Mwania sub-locations of Makueni County in Eastern Kenya to understand community and provider perceptions of the obstacles faced in providing and accessing maternal and newborn care at health facilities in their localities. Results: The study finds that the community perceives various challenges, most of which are infrastructural, including lack of electricity, water and poor roads that adversely impact the provision and access to essential life-saving maternal and newborn care services in the two sub-locations. Conclusions: The findings and recommendations from this study are important for the attention of policy makers and programme managers in order to improve the state of lower-tier health facilities serving rural communities and to strengthen infrastructure with the aim of making basic routine and emergency obstetric and newborn care services more accessible. © 2015 Essendi et al.},

The main aims of this process evaluation were to explore the implementation of the programme of training in Tanzania, how it was received, how or if the training has been implemented into practice and the challenges faced along the way. Design: Qualitative interviews with trainees, trainers, district officers and others exploring the application of the training into practice. Participants: During late 2010 and 2011, 36 trainees including 19 assistant medical officers one senior clinical officer and 16 nurse midwives/nurses (anaesthesia) were recruited from districts across rural Tanzania and invited to join the {ETATMBA} training programme. Results: Trainees (n=36) completed the training returning to 17 facilities, two left and one died shortly after training. Of the remaining trainees, 27 were interviewed at their health facility. Training was well received and knowledge and skills were increased. There were a number of challenges faced by trainees, not least that their new skills could not be practised because the facilities they returned to were not upgraded. Nonetheless, there is evidence that the training is having an effect locally on health outcomes, like maternal and neonatal mortality, and the trainees are sharing their new knowledge and skills with others. Conclusions: The outcome of this evaluation is encouraging but highlights that there are many ongoing challenges relating to infrastructure (including appropriate facilities, electricity and water) and the availability of basic supplies and drugs.

We report results from the analysis of data from maternal death reviews at Bugando Medical Centre north-western Tanzania in the period 2008-2012 and highlight the process, challenges and how the analysis provided a better understanding of maternal deaths. Methodology: Retrospective analysis using maternal death review data and extraction of missing information from patients' files. Analysis was done in {STATA} statistical package into frequencies and means ± {SD} and median with 95 \% {CI} for categorical and numerical data respectively. Results: There were 80 deaths; mean age of the deceased 27.1 ± 6.2 years and a median hospital stay of 11.0 days [95 \% {CI} 11.0-15.3]. Most deaths were from direct obstetric causes (90); 60 \% from eclampsia, severe pre-eclampsia, sepsis, abortion and anaesthetic complications. Information on {ANC} attendance was recorded in 36.2 \% of the forms and gestation age of the pregnancy resulting into the death in 23.8 \%. Sixty one deaths (76.3 \%) occurred after delivery. The mode of delivery, place of delivery and delivery assistant were recorded in 44 (72.1), 38 (62.3) and 23 (37.7 \%) respectively. Conclusion: Routine maternal death reviews in this setting do not involve comprehensive documentation of all relevant information, including actions taken to address some identified systemic weaknesses. Periodic analysis of available data may allow better understanding of vital information to improve the quality of maternity care. © 2015 Magoma et al.},

	abstract = {Background: In order to understand factors influencing fever/malaria management practices among community-based individuals, the study evaluated psychosocial, socio-demographic and environmental determinants of prompt and adequate healthcare-seeking behaviours. Methods: A quantitative household ({HH}) survey was conducted from December 2014 to February 2015 in Ruhuha sector, Bugesera district in the Eastern province of Rwanda. {HHs} that reported having had at least one member who experienced a fever and/or malaria episode in the previous 3 months prior to the study were included in the analysis. Healthcare-seeking behaviours associated with the last episode of illness were analysed. Socio-demographic, health facility access, long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets ({LLINs}), data on malaria knowledge, data and theory of planned behaviour ({TPB}) related variables (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control) with regard to fever/malaria healthcare seeking, were collected. The primary outcome was prompt and adequate care defined as: (1) seeking advice or treatment at a health facility (health centre or hospital) or from a community health worker ({CHW}); (2) advice or treatment seeking within same/next day of symptoms onset; (3) received a laboratory diagnosis; (4) received advice or treatment; and, (5) reported completing the prescribed dose of medication. Determinants of prompt and adequate care among presumed malaria cases were evaluated using a logistic regression analysis. Results: Overall, 302 (21 \%) of the 1410 interviewed {HHs} reported at least one member as having experienced a fever or malaria within the 3 months prior to the survey. The number of {HHs} (where at least one member reported fever/malaria) that reported seeking advice or treatment at a health facility (health centre or hospital) or from a {CHW} was 249 (82.4 \%). Of those who sought advice or treatment, 87.3 \% had done so on same/next day of symptoms developing, 82.8 \% received a laboratory diagnosis, and more than 90 \% who received treatment reported completing the prescribed dosage. Prompt and adequate care was reported from 162 of the 302 {HHs} (53.6 \%) that experienced fever or malaria for one or more {HH} members. Bivariate analyses showed that head of household ({HoH})-related characteristics including reported knowledge of three or more malaria symptoms, having health insurance, being able to pay for medical services, use of {LLINs} the night before the survey, having a positive attitude, perceiving social support, as well as a high-perceived behavioural control with regard to healthcare seeking, were all significantly associated with prompt and adequate care. In the final logistic regression model, a high-perceived behavioural control (odds ratio ({OR}) 5.068, p = 0.042), having a health insurance ({OR} 2.410, p = 0.044) and having knowledge of malaria symptoms ({OR} 1.654, p = 0.049) significantly predicted prompt and adequate care. Conclusions: To promote prompt and adequate care seeking for malaria in the area, particular emphasis should be placed on community-focused strategies that promote early malaria symptom recognition, increased health insurance coverage and enhanced perceived behavioural control with regard to healthcare-seeking. © 2016 Ingabire et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Tanzania has been a pioneer in establishing community-level services, yet challenges remain in sustaining these systems and ensuring adequate human resource strategies. In particular, the added value of a cadre of professional community health workers is under debate. While Tanzania has the highest density of primary health care facilities in Africa, equitable access and quality of care remain a challenge. Utilization for many services proven to reduce child and maternal mortality is unacceptably low. Tanzanian policy initiatives have sought to address these problems by proposing expansion of community-based providers, but the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare ({MoHSW}) lacks evidence that this merits national implementation. The Tanzania Connect Project is a randomized cluster trial located in three rural districts with a population of roughly 360,000 (Kilombero, Rufiji, and Ulanga). Description of intervention. Connect aims to test whether introducing a community health worker into a general program of health systems strengthening and referral improvement will reduce child mortality, improve access to services, expand utilization, and alter reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health seeking behavior; thereby accelerating progress towards Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5. Connect has introduced a new cadre - Community Health Agents ({CHA}) - who were recruited from and work in their communities. To support the {CHA}, Connect developed supervisory systems, launched information and monitoring operations, and implemented logistics support for integration with existing district and village operations. In addition, Connect's district-wide emergency referral strengthening intervention includes clinical and operational improvements. Evaluation design. Designed as a community-based cluster-randomized trial, {CHA} were randomly assigned to 50 of the 101 villages within the Health and Demographic Surveillance System ({HDSS}) in the three study districts. To garner detailed information on household characteristics, behaviors, and service exposure, a random sub-sample survey of 3,300 women of reproductive age will be conducted at the baseline and endline. The referral system intervention will use baseline, midline, and endline facility-based data to assess systemic changes. Implementation and impact research of Connect will assess whether and how the presence of the {CHA} at village level provides added life-saving value to the health system. Discussion. Global commitment to launching community-based primary health care has accelerated in recent years, with much of the implementation focused on Africa. Despite extensive investment, no program has been guided by a truly experimental study. Connect will not only address Tanzania's need for policy and operational research, it will bridge a critical international knowledge gap concerning the added value of salaried professional community health workers in the context of a high density of fixed facilities.

	abstract = {Background: Sierra Leone has among the poorest maternal and child health indicators in the world and investments in public health have been predominately to increase demand for services, with fewer initiatives targeting supply side factors that influence health workers' work environment. This paper uses data from the Quality Circles project in a rural district of Sierra Leone to achieve three objectives. First, we examine the effect of the intervention on organizational skills and relationships among coworkers as well as between health workers and traditional birth attendants. Second, we examine whether changes in organizational skills are associated with changes in relationships among and between formal and informal health providers and between health providers and clients. Third, we aim to further understand these changes through the perspectives of health workers and traditional birth attendants. Methods: The Quality Circles project was implemented in Kailahun District in the Eastern province of Sierra Leone from August 2011 to June 2013, with adjacent Tonkolili District serving as the control site. Using a mixed-methods approach, the evaluation included a quantitative survey, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with health workers and traditional birth attendants. Mean values of the variables of interest were compared across sub-populations, and correlation analyses were performed between changes in organizational skills and changes in relationships. Results: The results demonstrate that the Quality Circles intervention had positive effects on organizational skills and relationships. Furthermore, improvements in all organizational skill variables - problem-solving, strategizing and negotiation skills - were strongly associated with a change in the overall relationship variable. Conclusions: The Quality Circles approach has the potential to support health workers to improve their organizational skills and relationships, which in turn can contribute to improving the interpersonal dimensions of the quality of care in low-resource contexts. This method brings together peers in a structured process for constructive group work and individual skill development, which are important in low-resource contexts where active participation and resourcefulness of health workers can also contribute to better health service delivery. © 2015 Higgins-Steele et al; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: In communities with low rates of institutional delivery, little data exist on care-seeking behavior for potentially life-threatening obstetric complications. In this analysis, we sought to describe care-seeking patterns for self-reported complications and near misses in rural Bangladesh and to identify factors associated with care seeking for these conditions. Methods: Utilizing data from a community-randomized controlled trial enrolling 42,214 pregnant women between 2007 and 2011, we used multivariable multinomial logistic regression to explore the association of demographic and socioeconomic factors, perceived need, and service availability with care seeking for obstetric complications or near misses. We also used multivariable multinomial logistic regression to analyze the factors associated with care seeking by type of obstetric complication (eclampsia, sepsis, hemorrhage, and obstructed labor). Results: Out of 9,576 women with data on care seeking for obstetric complications, 77\% sought any care, with 29\% (n∈=∈2,150) visiting at least one formal provider and 70\% (n∈=∈5,149) visiting informal providers only. The proportion of women seeking at least one formal provider was highest among women reporting eclampsia (57\%), followed by hemorrhage (28\%), obstructed labor (22\%), and sepsis (17\%) (p∈{\textless}∈0.001). In multivariable analyses, socioeconomic factors such as living in a household from the highest wealth quartile (Relative Risk Ratio of 1.49; 95\% {CI} of [1.33-1.73]), women's literacy ({RRR} of 1.21; 95\% {CI} of [1.05-1.42]), and women's employment ({RRR} of 1.10; 95\% {CI} of [1.01-1.18]) were significantly associated with care seeking from formal providers. Service factors including living less than 10 kilometers from a health facility ({RRR} of 1.16; 95\% {CI} of [1.05-1.28]) and facility availability of comprehensive obstetric services ({RRR} of 1.25; 95\% {CI} of 1.04-1.36) were also significantly associated with seeking care from formal providers. Conclusions: While the majority of women reporting obstetric complications sought care, less than a third visited health facilities. Improvements in socioeconomic factors such as maternal literacy, coupled with improved geographic access and service availability, may increase care seeking from formal facilities. Enhancing community awareness on symptoms of hemorrhage, sepsis, and obstructed labor and their consequences may promote care seeking for obstetric complications in rural Bangladesh.

	abstract = {Background: Geographic accessibility to health facilities represents a fundamental barrier to utilisation of maternal and newborn health ({MNH}) services, driving historically hidden spatial pockets of localized inequalities. Here, we examine utilisation of {MNH} care as an emergent property of accessibility, highlighting high-resolution spatial heterogeneity and sub-national inequalities in receiving care before, during, and after delivery throughout five East African countries. Methods: We calculated a geographic inaccessibility score to the nearest health facility at 300 x 300 m using a dataset of 9,314 facilities throughout Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. Using Demographic and Health Surveys data, we utilised hierarchical mixed effects logistic regression to examine the odds of: 1) skilled birth attendance, 2) receiving 4+ antenatal care visits at time of delivery, and 3) receiving a postnatal health check-up within 48 hours of delivery. We applied model results onto the accessibility surface to visualise the probabilities of obtaining {MNH} care at both high-resolution and sub-national levels after adjusting for live births in 2015. Results: Across all outcomes, decreasing wealth and education levels were associated with lower odds of obtaining {MNH} care. Increasing geographic inaccessibility scores were associated with the strongest effect in lowering odds of obtaining care observed across outcomes, with the widest disparities observed among skilled birth attendance. Specifically, for each increase in the inaccessibility score to the nearest health facility, the odds of having skilled birth attendance at delivery was reduced by over 75\% (0.24; {CI}: 0.19-0.3), while the odds of receiving antenatal care decreased by nearly 25\% (0.74; {CI}: 0.61-0.89) and 40\% for obtaining postnatal care (0.58; {CI}: 0.45-0.75). Conclusions: Overall, these results suggest decreasing accessibility to the nearest health facility significantly deterred utilisation of all maternal health care services. These results demonstrate how spatial approaches can inform policy efforts and promote evidence-based decision-making, and are particularly pertinent as the world shifts into the Sustainable Goals Development era, where sub-national applications will become increasingly useful in identifying and reducing persistent inequalities. © 2016 Ruktanonchai et al.

	abstract = {Objectives: In the Tanzanian health system, women are expected to first visit their nearest front-line health facility ({FLF}) for delivery. However, women frequently bypass these {FLF}. Our study estimates the extent of bypassing for childbirth and assesses factors associated with this behaviour. Methods: Data describing the experiences of 597 women who recently delivered at a facility and the {EmONC} service capability at 107 health facilities were collected in 2011. Women who did not deliver at their nearest {FLF} were considered 'bypassers'. Factors associated with bypassing were assessed using multivariate logistic regression models. Three sets of analyses were conducted: among 597 women who delivered at the first facility they visited, among 521 women with no previous complications, and among 407 women not primigravida and without previous complications. Results: More than 75.4\% of women bypassed. In the fully adjusted model of all 597 women those who had experienced complications were more likely to bypass for delivery [{OR} = 6.31 (2.36, 16.86)]. In the fully adjusted model excluding women with previous complications, primigravida women were more likely to bypass [{OR} = 3.70 (1.71, 8.01)]. Fully adjusted models for each set of analysis found that, for each additional emergency obstetric and newborn care signal function ({EmONC} {SF}) available at the nearest {FLF}, women's odds of bypassing almost halved. Conclusions: Bypassing is highly associated with {EmONC} {SF} score at nearest {FLF}, controlling for individual and community-level factors. © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Diabetes is a chronic condition which requires many patients to use medications for the remainder of their lives. While this regimen is demanding, little research has been done on the experiences individuals have with diabetes medication use and the continuity of use, especially patients from rural areas of Tanzania. This study explores the lived experiences of diabetes medication use and the continuity of use among adult diabetes patients from rural communities with limited access to diabetes medicines. Methods: We conducted 19 in-depth interviews to explore patients' experiences with diabetes medication use and the continuity of use. We employed the 5As of access to care to situate the behavioral practices surrounding diabetes medication use in the study settings. The data analysis followed grounded theory principles, and was conducted with the help of {NVivo} 9. Results: Study participants expressed positive attitudes toward the use of diabetes medicines, but also concerns about affordability. The patients employed two main strategies for dealing with the cost. The first was to increase their available funds by spending less money on family needs, selling household property, asking family and friends for money, or borrowing cash. They also reported sourcing medicines from pharmacies to save on consultation and laboratory costs. Second, participants reported using less than the recommended dosage or skipping doses, and sharing medicines. The geographic accessibility of diabetes service providers, the availability of medication, and the organization of the diabetes services were also cited as barriers to taking medications and to using them continuously. Conclusions: The strategies employed by the people in this study illustrate their resilience in the face of poverty and failing health care systems. More comprehensive strategies are therefore needed to encourage consistent medication use among people with chronic conditions. These strategies could include the reduction of prices by pharmaceuticals, the strengthening of community risk-pooling mechanisms and sustained health campaigns aimed at patients and the community. © 2015 Metta et al.; licensee {BioMed} Central.},

The objective of this study was to map the evidence on national and international strategies for integration of {SRH} and {HIV} services in sub-Saharan Africa and to develop a research agenda for future health systems integration.; Methods: We examined the literature on national and international strategies to integrate {SRH} and {HIV} services using a scoping study methodology. Current policy frameworks, national {HIV} strategies and research, and gray literature on integration were mapped. Five countries in sub-Saharan Africa with experience of integrating {SRH} and {HIV} services were purposively sampled for detailed thematic analysis, according to the health systems functions of governance, policy and planning, financing, health workforce organization, service organization, and monitoring and evaluation.; Results: The major international health policies and donor guidance now support integration. Most integration research has focused on linkages of {SRH} and {HIV} front-line services. Yet, the common problems with implementation are related to delayed or incomplete integration of higher level health systems functions: lack of coordinated leadership and unified national integration policies; separate financing streams for {SRH} and {HIV} services and inadequate health worker training, supervision and retention.; Conclusions: Rigorous health systems research on the integration of {SRH} and {HIV} services is urgently needed. Priority research areas include integration impact, performance, and economic evaluation to inform the planning, financing, and coordination of integrated service delivery.

	abstract = {Background: Poor quality of care including fear of disrespect and abuse (D\&A) perpetuated by health workers influences women's decisions to seek maternity care. Key manifestations of D\&A include: physical abuse, non-consented care, non-confidential care, non-dignified care, discrimination, abandonment, and detention in facilities. This paper describes manifestations of D\&A experienced in Kenya and measures their prevalence. Methods: This paper is based on baseline data collected during a before-and-after study designed to measure the effect of a package of interventions to reduce the prevalence of D\&A experienced by women during labor and delivery in thirteen Kenyan health facilities. Data were collected through an exit survey of 641 women discharged from postnatal wards. We present percentages of D\&A manifestations and odds ratios of its relationship with demographic characteristics using a multivariate fixed effects logistic regression model. Results: Twenty percent of women reported any form of D\&A. Manifestations of D\&A includes: non-confidential care (8.5\%), non-dignified care (18\%), neglect or abandonment (14.3\%), Non-consensual care (4.3\%) physical abuse (4.2\%) and, detainment for non-payment of fees (8.1). Women aged 20-29 years were less likely to experience non-confidential care compared to those under 19; {OR}: [0.6 95\% {CI} (0.36, 0.90); p=0.017]. Clients with no companion during delivery were less likely to experience inappropriate demands for payment; {OR}: [0.49 (0.26, 0.95); p=0.037]; while women with higher parities were three times more likely to be detained for lack of payment and five times more likely to be bribed compared to those experiencing there first birth. Conclusion: One out of five women experienced feeling humiliated during labor and delivery. Six categories of D\&A during childbirth in Kenya were reported. Understanding the prevalence of D\&A is critical in developing interventions at national, health facility and community levels to address the factors and drivers that influence D\&A in facilities and to encourage clients' future facility utilization. © 2015 Abuya et al.},

In 2014, malaria burden in Brazil (143,910 microscopically confirmed cases and 41 malaria-related deaths) has reached its lowest levels in 35 years, Plasmodium falciparum is highly focal, and the geographic boundary of transmission has considerably shrunk. Transmission in Brazil remains entrenched in the Amazon Basin, which accounts for 99.5 \% of the country's malaria burden. This paper reviews major lessons learned from past and current malaria control policies in Brazil. A comprehensive discussion of the scientific and logistic challenges that may impact malaria elimination efforts in the country is presented in light of the launching of the Plan for Elimination of Malaria in Brazil in November 2015. Challenges for malaria elimination addressed include the high prevalence of symptomless and submicroscopic infections, emerging anti-malarial drug resistance in P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax and the lack of safe anti-relapse drugs, the largely neglected burden of malaria in pregnancy, the need for better vector control strategies where Anopheles mosquitoes present a highly variable biting behaviour, human movement, the need for effective surveillance and tools to identify foci of infection in areas with low transmission, and the effects of environmental changes and climatic variability in transmission. Control actions launched in Brazil and results to come are likely to influence control programs in other countries in the Americas. © 2016 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Universal Health Coverage ({UHC}) has emerged as a major goal for health care delivery in the post-2015 development agenda. It is viewed as a solution to health care needs in low and middle countries with growing enthusiasm at both national and global levels. Throughout the world, however, the paths of countries to {UHC} have differed. South Africa is currently reforming its health system with {UHC} through developing a national health insurance ({NHI}) program. This will be practically achieved through a decentralized approach, the district health system, the main vehicle for delivering services since democracy. Methods: We utilize a review of relevant documents, conducted between September 2014 and December 2015 of district health systems ({DHS}) and {UHC} and their ideological underpinnings, to explore the opportunities and challenges, of the district health system in achieving {UHC} in South Africa. Results: Review of data from the {NHI} pilot districts suggests that as South Africa embarks on reforms toward {UHC}, there is a need for a minimal universal coverage and emphasis on district particularity and positive discrimination so as to bridge health inequities. The disparities across districts in relation to health profiles/demographics, health delivery performance, management of health institutions or district management capacity, income levels/socio-economic status and social determinants of health, compliance with quality standards and above all the burden of disease can only be minimised through positive discrimination by paying more attention to underserved and disadavantaged communities. Conclusions: We conclude that in South Africa the {DHS} is pivotal to health reform and {UHC} may be best achieved through minimal universal coverage with positive discrimination to ensure disparities across districts in relation to disease burden, human resources, financing and investment, administration and management capacity, service readiness and availability and the health access inequalities are consciously implicated. Yet ideological and practical issues make its achievement problematic. © 2016 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Provision of quality emergency obstetric care relies upon the presence of skilled health attendants working in an environment where drugs and medical supplies are available when needed and in adequate quantity and of assured quality. This study aimed to describe the experience of rural health facility managers in ensuring the timely availability of drugs and medical supplies for emergency obstetric care ({EmOC}).Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with a total of 17 health facility managers: 14 from dispensaries and three from health centers. Two members of the Council Health Management Team and one member of the Council Health Service Board were also interviewed. A survey of health facilities was conducted to supplement the data. All the materials were analysed using a qualitative thematic analysis approach.Results: Participants reported on the unreliability of obtaining drugs and medical supplies for {EmOC}; this was supported by the absence of essential items observed during the facility survey. The unreliability of obtaining drugs and medical supplies was reported to result in the provision of untimely and suboptimal {EmOC} services. An insufficient budget for drugs from central government, lack of accountability within the supply system and a bureaucratic process of accessing the locally mobilized drug fund were reported to contribute to the current situation.Conclusion: The unreliability of obtaining drugs and medical supplies compromises the timely provision of quality {EmOC}. Multiple approaches should be used to address challenges within the health system that prevent access to essential drugs and supplies for maternal health. There should be a special focus on improving the governance of the drug delivery system so that it promotes the accountability of key players, transparency in the handling of information and drug funds, and the participation of key stakeholders in decision making over the allocation of locally collected drug funds. © 2014 Mkoka et al.; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: The knowledge on emergency obstetric care ({EmOC}) is limited in Kenya, where only partial data from sub-national studies exist. The {EmOC} process indicators have also not been integrated into routine health management information system to monitor progress in safe motherhood interventions both at national and lower levels of the health system. In a country with a high maternal mortality burden, the implication is that decision makers are unaware of the extent of need for life-saving care and, therefore, where to intervene. The objective of the study was to assess the actual existence and functionality of {EmOC} services at district level. Methods. This was a facility-based cross-sectional study. Data were collected from 40 health facilities offering delivery services in Malindi District, Kenya. Data presented are part of the "Response to accountable priority setting for trust in health systems" ({REACT}) study, in which {EmOC} was one of the service areas selected to assess fairness and legitimacy of priority setting in health care. The main outcome measures in this study were the number of facilities providing {EmOC}, their geographical distribution, and caesarean section rates in relation to World Health Organization ({WHO}) recommendations. Results: Among the 40 facilities assessed, 29 were government owned, seven were private and four were voluntary organisations. The ratio of {EmOC} facilities to population size was met (6.2/500,000), compared to the recommended 5/500,000. However, using the strict {WHO} definition, none of the facilities met the {EmOC} requirements, since assisted delivery, by vacuum or forceps was not provided in any facility. Rural-urban inequities in geographical distribution of facilities were observed. The facilities were not providing sufficient life-saving care as measured by caesarean section rates, which were below recommended levels (3.7\% in 2008 and 4.5\% in 2009). The rates were lower in the rural than in urban areas (2.1\% vs. 6.8\%; p {\textless} 0.001) in 2008 and (2.7\% vs. 7.7\%; p {\textless} 0.001) in 2009. Conclusions: The gaps in existence and functionality of {EmOC} services revealed in this study may point to the health system conditions contributing to lack of improvements in maternal survival in Kenya. As such, the findings bear considerable implications for policy and local priority setting. © 2013 Echoka et al.; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background:Access to safe drinking-water is a fundamental requirement for good health and is also a human right. Global access to safe drinking-water is monitored by {WHO} and {UNICEF} using as an indicator "use of an improved source," which does not account for water quality measurements. Our objectives were to determine whether water from "improved" sources is less likely to contain fecal contamination than "unimproved" sources and to assess the extent to which contamination varies by source type and setting.Methods and Findings:Studies in Chinese, English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish were identified from online databases, including {PubMed} and Web of Science, and grey literature. Studies in low- and middle-income countries published between 1990 and August 2013 that assessed drinking-water for the presence of Escherichia coli or thermotolerant coliforms ({TTC}) were included provided they associated results with a particular source type. In total 319 studies were included, reporting on 96,737 water samples. The odds of contamination within a given study were considerably lower for "improved" sources than "unimproved" sources (odds ratio [{OR}] = 0.15 [0.10-0.21], I2 = 80.3\% [72.9-85.6]). However over a quarter of samples from improved sources contained fecal contamination in 38\% of 191 studies. Water sources in low-income countries ({OR} = 2.37 [1.52-3.71]; p{\textless}0.001) and rural areas ({OR} = 2.37 [1.47-3.81] p{\textless}0.001) were more likely to be contaminated. Studies rarely reported stored water quality or sanitary risks and few achieved robust random selection. Safety may be overestimated due to infrequent water sampling and deterioration in quality prior to consumption.Conclusion:Access to an "improved source" provides a measure of sanitary protection but does not ensure water is free of fecal contamination nor is it consistent between source types or settings. International estimates therefore greatly overstate use of safe drinking-water and do not fully reflect disparities in access. An enhanced monitoring strategy would combine indicators of sanitary protection with measures of water quality.Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary. © 2014 Bain et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Most low- and middle- income countries are facing a rise of the burden of non-communicable diseases ({NCDs}) alongside the persistent burden of infectious diseases. This narrative review aims to provide an inventory of how the existing policy environment, health system, and communities are addressing the {NCDs} situation in Tanzania and identify gaps for advancing the {NCD} research and policy agenda. Methodology: A literature search was performed on {PubMed} and Google scholar with full text retrieval from {HINARI} of English language articles published between 2000 and 2012. Documents were read to extract information on what Tanzanian actors were doing that contributed to {NCDs} prevention, treatment, and control, and a narration was written out of these. Reference lists of all retrieved articles were searched for additional relevant articles. Websites of organizations active in the field of {NCDs} including the Government of Tanzania and {WHO} were searched for reports and grey literature. Results: Lack of a specific and overarching {NCD} policy has slowed and fragmented the implementation of existing strategies to prevent and control {NCDs} and their determinants. The health system is not prepared to deal with the rising {NCD} burden although there are random initiatives to improve this situation. How the community is responding to these emerging conditions is still unknown, and the current health-seeking behavior and perceptions on the risk factors may not favor control of {NCDs} and their risk factors. Conclusion and recommendation: There is limited information on the burden and determinants of {NCDs} to inform the design of an integrative and multisectorial policy. Evidence on effective interventions for {NCD} services in primary care levels and on community perceptions on {NCDs} and their care seeking is virtually absent. Research and public health interventions must be anchored in the policy, health system, and community platforms for a holistic response. © 2014 Emmy Metta et al.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Universal Health Coverage ({UHC}), referring to access to healthcare without financial burden, has received renewed attention in global health spheres. {UHC} is a potential goal in the post-2015 development agenda. Monitoring of progress towards achieving {UHC} is thus critical at both country and global level, and a monitoring framework for {UHC} was proposed by a joint {WHO}/World Bank discussion paper in December 2013. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of the framework proposed by {WHO}/World Bank for global {UHC} monitoring framework in Kenya. Methods: The study utilised three documents - the joint {WHO}/World Bank {UHC} monitoring framework and its update, and the Bellagio meeting report sponsored by {WHO} and the Rockefeller Foundation - to conduct the research. These documents informed the list of potential indicators that were used to determine the feasibility of the framework. A purposive literature search was undertaken to identify key government policy documents and relevant scholarly articles. A desk review of the literature was undertaken to answer the research objectives of this study. Results: Kenya has yet to establish an official policy on {UHC} that provides a clear mandate on the goals, targets and monitoring and evaluation of performance. However, a significant majority of Kenyans continue to have limited access to health services as well as limited financial risk protection. The country has the capacity to reasonably report on five out of the seven proposed {UHC} indicators. However, there was very limited capacity to report on the two service coverage indicators for the chronic condition and injuries ({CCIs}) interventions. Out of the potential tracer indicators (n = 27) for aggregate {CCI}-related measures, four tracer indicators were available. Moreover the country experiences some wider challenges that may impact on the implementation and feasibility of the {WHO}/World Bank framework. Conclusion: The proposed global framework for monitoring {UHC} will only be feasible in Kenya if systemic challenges are addressed. While the infrastructure for reporting the {MDG} related indicators is in place, Kenya will require continued international investment to extend its capacity to meet the data requirements of the proposed {UHC} monitoring framework, particularly for the {CCI}-related indicators. © 2014 Obare et al.},

	abstract = {Objective: To examine the associations between perceived quality of care and patient satisfaction among {HIV} and non-{HIV} patients in Zambia. Setting: Patient exit survey conducted at 104 primary, secondary and tertiary health clinics across 16 Zambian districts. Participants: 2789 exiting patients. Primary independent variables: Five dimensions of perceived quality of care (health personnel practice and conduct, adequacy of resources and services, healthcare delivery, accessibility of care, and cost of care). Secondary independent variables: Respondent, visit-related, and facility characteristics. Primary outcome measure: Patient satisfaction measured on a 1-10 scale. Methods: Indices of perceived quality of care were modelled using principal component analysis. Statistical associations between perceived quality of care and patient satisfaction were examined using random-effect ordered logistic regression models, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, visit and facility characteristics. Results: Average satisfaction was 6.9 on a 10-point scale for non-{HIV} services and 7.3 for {HIV} services. Favourable perceptions of health personnel conduct were associated with higher odds of overall satisfaction for non-{HIV} ({OR}=3.53, 95\% {CI} 2.34 to 5.33) and {HIV} ({OR}=11.00, 95\% {CI} 3.97 to 30.51) visits. Better perceptions of resources and services were also associated with higher odds of satisfaction for both non-{HIV} ({OR}=1.66, 95\% {CI} 1.08 to 2.55) and {HIV} ({OR}=4.68, 95\% {CI} 1.81 to 12.10) visits. Two additional dimensions of perceived quality of care-healthcare delivery and accessibility of care-were positively associated with higher satisfaction for non-{HIV} patients. The odds of overall satisfaction were lower in rural facilities for non-{HIV} patients ({OR} 0.69; 95\% {CI} 0.48 to 0.99) and {HIV} patients ({OR}=0.26, 95\% {CI} 0.16 to 0.41). For non-{HIV} patients, the odds of satisfaction were greater in hospitals compared with health centres/ posts ({OR} 1.78; 95\% {CI} 1.27 to 2.48) and lower at publicly-managed facilities ({OR}=0.41, 95\% {CI}=0.27 to 0.64).

	abstract = {Background: Tanzania is among ten countries that account for a majority of the world's newborn deaths. However, data on time-to-discharge after facility delivery, receipt of postpartum messaging by time to discharge and women's experiences in the time preceding discharge from a facility after childbirth are limited. Methods: Household survey of 1267 women who delivered in the preceding 2-14 months; in-depth interviews with 24 women, 12 husbands, and 5 community elders. Results: Two-thirds of women with vaginal, uncomplicated births departed within 12 h; 90 \% within 24 h, and 95 \% within 48 h. Median departure times varied significantly across facilities (hospital: 23 h, health center: 10 h, dispensary: 7 h, p {\textless} 0.001). Quantitative and qualitative data highlight the importance of type of facility and facility amenities in determining time-to-discharge. In multiple logistic regression, level of facility (hospital, health center, dispensary) was the only significant predictor of early discharge (p = 0.001). However across all types of facilities a majority of women depart before 24 h ranging from hospitals (54 \%) to health centers (64 \%) to dispensaries (74 \%). Most women who experienced a delivery complication (56 \%), gave birth by caesarean section (90 \%), or gave birth to a pre-term baby (70 \%) stayed longer than 24 h. Reasons for early discharge include: facility practices including discharge routines and working hours and facility-based discomforts for women and those who accompany them to facilities. Provision of postpartum counseling was inadequate regardless of time to discharge and regardless of type of facility where delivery occurred. Conclusion: Our quantitative and qualitative findings indicate that the level of facility care and comforts existing or lacking in a facility have the greatest effect on time to discharge. This suggests that individual or interpersonal characteristics play a limited role in deciding whether a woman would stay for shorter or longer periods. Implementation of a policy of longer stay must incorporate enhanced postpartum counseling and should be sensitive to women's perceptions that it is safe and beneficial to leave hospitals soon after birth. © 2015 {McMahon} et al.},

	abstract = {Objectives Optimal radiation therapy ({RT}) utilisation rates ({RURs}) have been defined for various cancer indications through extensive work in Australia and overseas. These benchmarks remain unrealised. The gap between optimal {RUR} and actual {RUR} has been attributed to inadequacies in '{RT} access'. We aimed to develop a conceptual framework for the consideration of '{RT} access' by examining the literature for existing constructs and translating it to the context of {RT} services. We further aimed to use this framework to identify and examine factors influencing '{RT} access'. Methods Existing models of health care access were reviewed and used to develop a multi-dimensional conceptual framework for '{RT} access'. A review of the literature was then conducted to identify factors reported to affect {RT} access and utilisation. The electronic databases searched, the host platform and date range of the databases searched were Ovid {MEDLINE}, 1946 to October 2014 and {PsycINFOvia} {OvidSP},1806 to October 2014. Results The framework developed demonstrates that '{RT} access' encompasses opportunity for {RT} as well as the translation of this opportunity to {RT} utilisation. Opportunity for {RT} includes availability, affordability, adequacy (quality) and acceptability of {RT} services. Several factors at the consumer, referrer and {RT} service levels affect the translation of this opportunity for {RT} to actual {RT} utilisation. Conclusion 'Access' is a term that is widely used in the context of health service related research, planning and political discussions. It is a multi-faceted concept with many descriptions. We propose a conceptual framework for the consideration of '{RT} access' so that factors affecting {RT} access and utilisation may be identified and examined. Understanding these factors, and quantifying them where possible, will allow objective evaluation of their impact on {RT} utilisation and guide implementation of strategies to modify their effects. What is known about the topic? It is well documented that the use of {RT} in Australia is well below evidence-based benchmarks. The shortfall in the use of {RT} has been attributed to problems with access to treatment services. Although considerable attention has been directed (rightly) towards addressing infrastructure needs, access to {RT} is more than just supply of services. There is currently no specific framework for {RT} access to comprehensively consider and examine other factors influencing the use of {RT}. The existing international literature addresses some of the influencing factors. However, there is a need for a detailed review of all actual and potential influencers of {RT} utilisation. What does this paper add? This paper presents a conceptual framework for the specific consideration of access to {RT}. A detailed review of various factors affecting access and utilisation of {RT} has been performed using the aforementioned conceptual framework. To our knowledge this is the first such review and hence we are confident that it adds to the existing international literature on this subject. What are the implications for practitioners? The topic of improving consumers' access to {RT} is of relevance locally, in Australia, as well as internationally. We feel that the {RT} access framework proposed herein will be of interest and use to those involved in health services research, delivery and policy, especially those involved with the planning and delivering of cancer services. In addition to compiling evidence on the subject, the review of factors influencing {RT} utilisation highlights and proposes areas for future translational and implementation research in the areas of health services and treatment-related decision making. © {AHHA} 2016.},

	abstract = {Background: Tanzania achieved the Millennium Development Goal for child survival, yet made insufficient progress for maternal and neonatal survival and stillbirths, due to low coverage and quality of services for care at birth, with rural women left behind. Our study aimed to evaluate Tanzania's subnational (regional-level) variations for rural care at birth outcomes, i.e., rural women giving birth in a facility and by Caesarean section (C-section), and associations with health systems inputs (financing, health workforce, facilities, and commodities), outputs (readiness and quality of care) and context (education and {GDP}). Methods: We undertook correlation analyses of subnational-level associations between health system inputs, outputs, context, and rural care at birth outcomes; and constructed implementation readiness barometers using benchmarks for each health system input indicator. We used geographical information system ({GIS}) mapping to visualise subnational variations in care at birth for rural women, with a focus on service availability and readiness, and collected qualitative data to investigate financial flows from national to council level to understand variation in financing inputs. Results: We found wide subnational variation for rural care at birth outcomes, health systems inputs, and contextual indicators. There was a positive association between rural women giving birth in a facility and by C-section; maternal education; workforce and facility density; and quality of care. There was a negative association between these outcomes and proportion of all births to rural women, total fertility rate, and availability of essential commodities at facilities. Per capita recurrent expenditure was positively associated with facility births (correlation coefficient = 0.43; p = 0.05) but not with C-section. Qualitative results showed that the health financing system is complex and insufficient for providing care at birth services. Bottlenecks for care at birth included low density of health workers, poor availability of essential commodities, and low health financing in Lake and Western Zones. Conclusions: No region meets the benchmarks for the four health systems building blocks including health finance, health workforce, health facilities, and commodities. Strategies for addressing health system inequities, including overall increases in health expenditure, are needed in rural populations and areas of highest unmet need for family planning to improve coverage of care at birth for rural women in Tanzania. © 2016 The Author(s).},

In 2015, many {LMICs} are facing a multifaceted burden of infectious disease, maternal disease, neonatal disease, non-communicable diseases, and injuries. Surgical and anaesthesia care are essential for the treatment of many of these conditions and represent an integral component of a functional, responsive, and resilient health system. In view of the large projected increase in the incidence of cancer, road traffi c injuries, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in {LMICs}, the need for surgical services in these regions will continue to rise substantially from now until 2030. Reduction of death and disability hinges on access to surgical and anaesthesia care, which should be available, aff ordable, timely, and safe to ensure good coverage, uptake, and outcomes. Despite growing need, the development and delivery of surgical and anaesthesia care in {LMICs} has been nearly absent from the global health discourse. Little has been written about the human and economic eff ect of surgical conditions, the state of surgical care, or the potential strategies for scale-up of surgical services in {LMICs}. To begin to address these crucial gaps in knowledge, policy, and action, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery was launched in January, 2014. The Commission brought together an international, multidisciplinary team of 25 commissioners, supported by advisors and collaborators in more than 110 countries and six continents. We formed four working groups that focused on the domains of health-care delivery and management; workforce, training, and education; economics and fi nance; and information management. Our Commission has fi ve key messages, a set of indicators and recommendations to improve access to safe, aff ordablesurgical and anaesthesia care in {LMICs}, and a template for a national surgical plan. Our fi ve key messages are presented as follows: 5 billion people do not have access to safe, aff ordable surgical and anaesthesia care when needed. Access is worst in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, where nine of ten people cannot access basic surgical care. 143 million additional surgical procedures are needed in {LMICs} each year to save lives and prevent disability. Of the 313 million procedures undertaken worldwide each year, only 6\% occur in the poorest countries, where over a third of the world's population lives. Low operative volumes are associated with high case-fatality rates from common, treatable surgical conditions. Unmet need is greatest in eastern, western, and central sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia. 33 million individuals face catastrophic health expenditure due to payment for surgery and anaesthesia care each year. An additional 48 million cases of catastrophic expenditure are attributable to the nonmedical costs of accessing surgical care. A quarter of people who have a surgical procedure will incur fi nancial catastrophe as a result of seeking care. The burden of catastrophic expenditure for surgery is highest in low-income and lower-middle-income countries and, within any country, lands most heavily on poor people. Investing in surgical services in {LMICs} is aff ordable, saves lives, and promotes economic growth. To meet present and projected population demands, urgent investment in human and physical resources for surgical and anaesthesia care is needed. If {LMICs} were to scale-up surgical services at rates achieved by the present best-performing {LMICs}, two-thirds of countries would be able to reach a minimum operative volume of 5000 surgical procedures per 100 000 population by 2030. Without urgent and accelerated investment in surgical scale-up, {LMICs} will continue to have losses in economic productivity, estimated cumulatively at {US} \$12.3 trillion (2010 {US}\$, purchasing power parity) between 2015 and 2030. Surgery is an "indivisible, indispensable part of health care."1 Surgical and anaesthesia care should be an integral component of a national health system in countries at all levels of development. Surgical services are a prerequisite for the full attainment of local andglobal health goals in areas as diverse as cancer, injury, cardiovascular disease, infection, and reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health. Universal health coverage and the health aspirations set out in the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals will be impossible to achieve without ensuring that surgical and anaesthesia care is available, accessible, safe, timely, and aff ordable. In summary, the Commission's key fi ndings show that the human and economic consequences of untreated surgical conditions in {LMICs} are large and for many years have gone unrecognised. During the past two decades, global health has focused on individual diseases. The development of integrated health services and health systems has been somewhat neglected. As such, surgical care has been aff orded low priority in the world's poorest regions. Our report presents a clear challenge to this approach. As a new era of global health begins in 2015, the focus should be on the development of broad-based health-systems solutions, and resources should be allocated accordingly. Surgical care has an incontrovertible, cross-cutting role in achievement of local and global health challenges. It is an important part of the solution to many diseases-for both old threats and new challenges-and a crucial component of a functional, responsive, and resilient health system. The health gains from scaling up surgical care in {LMICs} are great and the economic benefi ts substantial. They accrue across all disease-cause categories and at all stages of life, but especially benefi t our youth and young adult populations. The provision of safe and aff ordable surgical and anaesthesia care when needed not only reduces premature death and disability, but also boosts welfare, economic productivity, capacity, and freedoms, contributing to longterm development. Our six core surgical indicators(table 1) should be tracked and reported by all countries and global health organisations, such as the World Bank through the World Development Indicators, {WHO} through the Global Reference List of 100 Core Health Indicators, and entities tracking the {SDGs}. At the opening meeting of the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery in January, 2014, Jim Kim, President of the World Bank, stated that: "surgery is an indivisible, indispensable part of health care" and "can help millions of people lead healthier, more productive lives. In 2015, good reason exists to ensure that access to surgical and anaesthesia care is realised for all.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12978-016-0163-7},
	abstract = {Background: In Senegal, only 12 \% of women of reproductive age in union ({WRAU}) were using contraceptives and another 29 \% had an unmet need for contraceptives in 2010-11. One potential barrier to accessing contraceptives is the lack of stock availability in health facilities where women seek them. Multiple supply chain interventions have been piloted in low- and middle-income countries with the aim of improving contraceptive availability in health facilities. However, there is limited evidence on the effect of these interventions on contraceptive availability in facilities, and in turn on family planning use in the population. This evaluation protocol pertains to a supply chain intervention using performance-based contracting for contraceptive distribution that was introduced throughout Senegal between 2012 and 2015. Methods: This multi-disciplinary research project will include quantitative, qualitative and economic evaluations. Trained researchers in the different disciplines will implement the studies separately but alongside each other, sharing findings throughout the project to inform each other's data collection. A non-randomised study with stepped-wedge design will be used to estimate the effect of the intervention on contraceptive stock availability in health facilities, and on the modern contraceptive prevalence rate among women in Senegal, compared to the current pull-based distribution model used for other commodities. Secondary data from annual Service Provision Assessments and Demographic and Health Surveys will be used for this study. Data on stock availability and monthly family planning consultations over a 4-year period will be collected from 200 health facilities in five regions to perform time series analyses. A process evaluation will be conducted to understand the extent to which the intervention was implemented as originally designed, the acceptability of third-party logisticians within the health system and potential unintended consequences. These will be assessed using monthly indicator data from the implementer and multiple ethnographic methods, including in-depth interviews with key informants and stakeholders at all levels of the distribution system, observations of third-party logisticians and clinic diaries. An economic evaluation will estimate the cost of the intervention, as well as its cost-effectiveness compared to the current supply chain model. Discussion: Given the very limited evidence base, there is an important need for a comprehensive standardised approach to evaluating supply chain management, and distribution specifically. This evaluation will help address this evidence gap by providing rigorous evidence on whether private performance-based contracting for distribution of contraceptives can contribute to improving access to family planning in low- and middle-income countries. © 2016 Cavallaro et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Family planning has been shown to be an effective intervention for promoting maternal, newborn and child health. Despite family planning's multiple benefits, women's experiences of - or concerns related to - side effects present a formidable barrier to the sustained use of contraceptives, particularly in the postpartum period. This paper presents perspectives of postpartum, rural, Tanzanian women, their partners, public opinion leaders and community and health facility providers related to side effects associated with contraceptive use. Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with postpartum women (n = 34), their partners (n = 23), community leaders (n = 12) and health providers based in both facilities (n = 12) and communities (n = 19) across Morogoro Region, Tanzania. Following data collection, digitally recorded data were transcribed, translated and coded using thematic analysis. Results: Respondents described family planning positively due to the health and economic benefits associated with limiting and spacing births. However, side effects were consistently cited as a reason that women and their partners choose to forgo family planning altogether, discontinue methods, switch methods or use methods in an intermittent (and ineffective) manner. Respondents detailed side effects including excessive menstrual bleeding, missed menses, weight gain and fatigue. Women, their partners and community leaders also described concerns that contraceptives could induce sterility in women, or harm breastfeeding children via contamination of breast milk. Use of family planning during the postpartum period was viewed as particularly detrimental to a newborn's health in the first months of life. Conclusions: To meet Tanzania's national target of increasing contraceptive use from 34 to 60 \% by 2015, appropriate counseling and dialogue on contraceptive side effects that speaks to pressing concerns outlined by women, their partners, communities and service providers are needed. © 2015 Chebet et al.},

We conducted an exploratory analysis to identify factors associated with utilization of {ANC} 4 and {ANC} 4 decline among pregnant women over time. We used data from 8035 women who delivered within two years preceding Tanzania Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 1999, 2004/05 and 2010. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association between all potential factors and utilization of {ANC} 4; and decline in {ANC} 4 over time. Factors positively associated with {ANC} 4 utilization were higher quality of services, testing and counseling for {HIV} during {ANC}, receiving two or more doses of {SP} (Sulphadoxine Pyrimethamine)/Fansidar for preventing malaria during {ANC} and higher educational status of the woman. Negatively associated factors were residing in a zone other than Eastern zone, never married woman, reported long distance to health facility, first {ANC} visit after four months of pregnancy and woman's desire to avoid pregnancy. The factors significantly associated with decline in utilization of {ANC} 4 were: geographic zone and age of the woman at delivery. Strategies to increase {ANC} 4 utilization should focus on improvement in quality of care, geographic accessibility, early {ANC} initiation, and services that allow women to avoid pregnancy. The interconnected nature of the Tanzanian Health System is reflected in {ANC} 4 decline over time where introduction of new programs might have had unintended effects on existing programs. An in-depth assessment of the recent policy change towards Focused Antenatal Care and its implementation across different geographic zones, including its effect on the perception and understanding among women and performance and counseling by health providers can help explain the decline in {ANC} 4.},

	abstract = {{HIV} prevalence is rising and has been consistently higher among women in Rwanda whereas a decreasing national {HIV} prevalence rate in the adult population has stabilised since 2005. Factors explaining the increased vulnerability of women to {HIV} infection are not currently well understood. A statistical mapping at smaller geographic units and the identification of key {HIV} risk factors are crucial for pragmatic and more efficient interventions. The data used in this study were extracted from the 2010 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey data for 6952 women. A full Bayesian geo-additive logistic regression model was fitted to data in order to assess the effect of key risk factors and map district-level spatial effects on the risk of {HIV} infection. The results showed that women who had {STIs}, concurrent sexual partners in the 12 months prior to the survey, a sex debut at earlier age than 19 years, were living in a woman-headed or high-economic status household were significantly associated with a higher risk of {HIV} infection. There was a protective effect of high {HIV} knowledge and perception. Women occupied in agriculture, and those residing in rural areas were also associated with lower risk of being infected. This study provides district-level maps of the variation of {HIV} infection among women of child-bearing age in Rwanda. The maps highlight areas where women are at a higher risk of infection; the aspect that proximate and distal factors alone could not uncover. There are distinctive geographic patterns, although statistically insignificant, of the risk of {HIV} infection suggesting potential effectiveness of district specific interventions. The results also suggest that changes in sexual behaviour can yield significant results in controlling {HIV} infection in Rwanda. © 2015 Niragire et al.},

In its 2012 Global Vaccine Action Plan ({GVAP}), the World Health Assembly recommended establishing a comprehensive vaccination resource tracking system to better understand the source and recipients of these funds, and ultimately their impact on outcomes. This systematic review aims to respond to the {GVAP} recommendation in reviewing and assessing the state of the data and literature on vaccination resource tracking.; Methods. We scrutinized all relevant vaccination resource tracking systems identified in the literature and by practitioners in the field. We examined schemes used elsewhere in the health sector and by other sectors. Informant interviews were also conducted to determine what data exists and how it might be utilized. With this information, we completed a qualitative assessment of existing approaches to vaccination resources tracking.; Results: Tracking systems provide information about some vaccine-related activity in the majority of low- and middle-income countries. Data are generally available for the period of 2006-2010. Levels of granularity vary. Interviewees were concerned about the degree of rigor used to validate the data and the lack of verification. Data are often presented in tabular form, which may be unwieldy for non-technical audiences.; Conclusions: The schemes currently in place to track the resources available for vaccinations were fairly advanced relative to other mechanisms in the health sector. Nonetheless, the coverage, validity, and accessibility of vaccination resource tracking data could be ameliorated. Establishing improved feedback loops and verification mechanisms that connect country-level administrators and the international organizations that support reporting efforts would enhance data quality. © 2014Leach-Kemon et al.; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

A comprehensive search using key words and phrases was conducted using the web search engines Google and Google Scholar, as well as the databases of {PubMed}, {ERIC}, {EMBASE}, {CINAHL}, {OvidSP} ({MEDLINE}), {PSYC} Info, Springer Link, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ({CENTRAL}), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched. A total of 147 relevant international and Ugandan literature sources meeting the inclusion criteria were included. This review provides an insightful understanding on six topic areas: global and local priorities, malarial pathology, disease burden, malaria control, treatment guidelines for uncomplicated malaria, and role of the health system in accessing antimalarial medicines. Plasmodium falciparum remains the most common cause of malaria in Uganda, with children under five being most vulnerable due to their underdeveloped immunity. While international efforts to scale up malaria control measures have resulted in considerable decline in malaria incidence and mortality in several regions of sub-Saharan Africa, this benefit has yet to be substantiated for Uganda. At the local level, key initiatives have included implementation of a new antimalarial drug policy in 2004 and strengthening of government health systems and programs. Examples of such programs include removal of user fees, training of frontline health workers, providing free {ACT} from government systems and subsidized {ACT} from licensed private outlets, and introduction of the integrated community case management program to bring diagnostics and treatment for malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea closer to the community. However despite notable efforts, Uganda is far from achieving its 2010 targets. Several challenges in the delivery of care and treatment remain, with those most vulnerable and living in rural settings remaining at greatest risk from malaria morbidity and mortality. © 2015 The Authors.

	abstract = {Nigeria has more {HIV}-infected women who do not receive needed services for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of {HIV} ({PMTCT}) than any other nation in the world. To meet the {UNAIDS}/{WHO} goal of eliminating mother-to-child {HIV} transmission by 2015, multiple interventions will be required to scale up {PMTCT} services, especially to lower-level, rural health facilities. To address this, we are conducting a cluster-randomized controlled study to evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of a novel, family-focused integrated package of {PMTCT} services. A systematic re-assignment of patient care responsibilities coupled with the adoption of point-of-care {CD}4. + cell count testing could facilitate the ability of lower-cadre health providers to manage {PMTCT} care, including the provision and scale-up of antiretroviral therapy ({ART}) to pregnant women in rural settings. Additionally, as influential community members, male partners could support their partners' uptake of and adherence to {PMTCT} care. We describe an innovative approach to scaling up {PMTCT} service provision that incorporates considerations of where and from whom women can access services (task-shifting), ease of obtaining a {CD}4. + cell count result (point-of-care testing), the degree of {HIV} service integration for {HIV}-infected women and their infants, and the level of family and community involvement (specifically male partner involvement). This systematic approach, if proven feasible and effective, could be scaled up in Nigeria and similar resource-limited settings as a means to accelerate progress toward eliminating mother-to-child transmission of {HIV} and help women with {HIV} infection take {ART} and live long, healthy lives (Trial registration: {NCT}01805752). © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of stunting in children less than five years of age is elevated in Rwanda. It is one of the main health challenges upon which the government is struggling to achieve progress. Health centers and district hospitals in Rwanda are expected to provide a package of health services including nutrition related activities, nutritional rehabilitation, education, and growth monitoring. They can hence play a potent role in alleviating malnutrition and stunting in Rwanda. This study tested whether travel time from household clusters to the nearest health center was significantly and negatively associated with the distribution of height-for-age z-scores of younger than five year old children in the eastern province of Rwanda. Data for 974 children was extracted from the Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}) database. However, since {DHS} does not contain any information on travel time to health centers, the latter was simulated using {AccessMod} 4.0, an extension to {ArcGIS} 9.3.1 that simulates health facilities' catchment areas and travel times to health facilities. Travel time was found to be negatively associated with height-for-age z-scores at the 5\% level in a stepwise regression analysis that controlled for wealth index, mother's primary and secondary education, sex of the child, preceding birth interval, and birth order of the child. Field measurements are needed to validate travel time. If validated, results point to the importance of improved access to healthcare facilities as a potential pathway in reducing stunting in Rwanda. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Other major outbreaks in the recent past, in Northern Uganda and in the Democratic Republic of Congo are similarly afflicted although outbreaks have also occurred in stable settings. Although the 2014-15 outbreak in West Africa has received more attention than almost any other public health issue in recent months, very little of that attention has focused on the complex interaction between conflict and its aftermath and its implications for health systems, the emergence of the disease and the success or failure in controlling it. The health systems of conflict-affected states are characterized by a series of weaknesses, some common to other low and even middle income countries, others specifically conflict-related. Added to this is the burden placed on health systems by the aggravated health problems associated with conflict. Other features of post conflict health systems are a consequence of the global institutional response. Comparing the experience of Northern Uganda and Sierra Leone in the emergence and management of Ebola outbreaks in 2000-1 and in 2014-15 respectively highlights how the various elements of these conflict affected societies came together with international agencies responses to permit the outbreak of the disease and then to successfully contain it (in Northern Uganda) or to fail to do so before a catastrophic cost had been incurred (in Sierra Leone). These case studies have implications for the types of investments in health systems that are needed to enable effective response to Ebola and other zoonotic diseases where they arise in conflict- affected settings. © 2015 {McPake} et al.},

This article describes how a successful pilot program to integrate the Standard Days Method ({SDM}) of family planning into existing Ministry of Health services was scaled up nationally in Rwanda. Much of the success of the scale-up effort was due to systematic use of monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) data from several sources to make midcourse corrections. Four lessons learned illustrate this crucially important approach. First, ongoing M\&E data showed that provider training protocols and client materials that worked in the pilot phase did not work at scale; therefore, we simplified these materials to support integration into the national program. Second, triangulation of ongoing monitoring data with national health facility and population-based surveys revealed serious problems in supply chain mechanisms that affected {SDM} (and the accompanying {CycleBeads} client tool) availability and use; new procedures for ordering supplies and monitoring stockouts were instituted at the facility level. Third, supervision reports and special studies revealed that providers were imposing unnecessary medical barriers to {SDM} use; refresher training and revised supervision protocols improved provider practices. Finally, informal environmental scans, stakeholder interviews, and key events timelines identified shifting political and health policy environments that influenced scale-up outcomes; ongoing advocacy efforts are addressing these issues. The {SDM} scale-up experience in Rwanda confirms the importance of monitoring and evaluating programmatic efforts continuously, using a variety of data sources, to improve program outcomes.},

Of the 144,744 malaria cases recorded in Namibia in 2009, 134,851 were suspected and 9893 were parasitologically confirmed. The mean annual incidence based on the Bayesian model predictions was 13 cases per 1000 population with the highest incidence predicted for constituencies bordering Angola and Zambia.

	abstract = {Background: Since 2004, malaria interventions in Rwanda have resulted in substantial decline of malaria incidence. However, this achievement is fragile as potentials for local malaria transmissions remain. The risk of getting malaria infection is partially explained by social conditions of vulnerable populations. Since vulnerability to malaria is both influenced by social and environmental factors, its complexity cannot be measured by a single value. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to apply a composite indicator approach for assessing social vulnerability to malaria in Rwanda. This assessment informs the decision-makers in targeting malaria interventions and allocating limited resources to reduce malaria burden in Rwanda. Methods: A literature review was used to conceptualize the social vulnerability to malaria and to select the appropriate vulnerability indicators. Indicators used in the index creation were classified into susceptibility and lack of resilience vulnerability domains. The main steps followed include selection of indicators and datasets, imputation of missing values, descriptive statistics, normalization and weighting of indicators, local sensitivity analysis and indicators aggregation. Correlation analysis helped to empirically evidence the association between the indicators and malaria incidence. Results: The high values of social vulnerability to malaria are found in Gicumbi, Rusizi, Nyaruguru and Gisagara, and low values in Muhanga, Nyarugenge, Kicukiro and Nyanza. The most influential susceptibility indicators to increase malaria are population change (r = 0.729), average number of persons per bedroom (r = 0.531), number of households affected by droughts and famines (r = 0.591), and area used for irrigation (r = 0.611). The bed net ownership (r =-0.398) and poor housing wall materials (0.378) are the lack of resilience indicators that significantly correlate with malaria incidence. Conclusions: The developed composite index social vulnerability to malaria indicates which indicators need to be addressed and in which districts. The results from this study are salient for public health policy- and decision makers in malaria control in Rwanda and timely support the national integrated malaria initiative. Future research development should focus on spatial explicit vulnerability assessment by combining environmental and social drivers to achieve an integrated and complete assessment of vulnerability to malaria. © 2015 Bizimana et al.; licensee {BioMed} Central.},

We propose a 'mashup' index that captures both aspects of {UHC}: that everyone-irrespective of their ability-to-pay-gets the health services they need; and that nobody suffers undue financial hardship as a result of receiving care. We break service coverage into prevention and treatment, and financial protection into impoverishment and catastrophic spending; we use nationally representative household survey data to adjust population averages to capture inequalities between the poor and better off; we allow non-linear trade-offs between and within the two dimensions of the {UHC} index; and we express all indicators such that scores run from 0 to 100, and higher scores are better. In a sample of 24 countries for which we have detailed information on {UHC}-inspired reforms, we find a cluster of high-performing countries with {UHC} scores of between 79 and 84 (Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, and South Africa) and a cluster of low-performing countries with {UHC} scores in the range 35-57 (Ethiopia, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam). We find that countries have mostly improved their {UHC} scores between the earliest and latest years for which we have data-by about 5 points on average. However, the improvement has come from increases in receipt of key health interventions, not from reductions in the incidence of out-of-pocket payments on welfare. © The Authors 2016.},

	abstract = {Background Estimates of the burden of disease in adults in sub-Saharan Africa largely rely on models of sparse data. We aimed to measure the burden of disease in adults living in a rural area of coastal Kenya with use of linked clinical and demographic surveillance data. Methods: We used data from 18 712 adults admitted to Kilifi District Hospital (Kilifi, Kenya) between Jan 1, 2007, and Dec 31, 2012, linked to 790 635 person-years of observation within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System, to establish the rates and major causes of admission to hospital. These data were also used to model disease-specific disability-adjusted life-years lost in the population. We used geographical mapping software to calculate admission rates stratified by distance from the hospital. Findings: The main causes of admission to hospital in women living within 5 km of the hospital were infectious and parasitic diseases (303 per 100 000 person-years of observation), pregnancy-related disorders (239 per 100 000 person-years of observation), and circulatory illnesses (105 per 100 000 person-years of observation). Leading causes of hospital admission in men living within 5 km of the hospital were infectious and parasitic diseases (169 per 100 000 person-years of observation), injuries (135 per 100 000 person-years of observation), and digestive system disorders (112 per 100 000 person-years of observation). {HIV}-related diseases were the leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years lost (2050 per 100 000 person-years of observation), followed by non-communicable diseases (741 per 100 000 person-years of observation). For every 5 km increase in distance from the hospital, all-cause admission rates decreased by 11\% (95\% {CI} 7-14) in men and 20\% (17-23) in women. The magnitude of this decline was highest for endocrine disorders in women (35\%; 95\% {CI} 22-46) and neoplasms in men (30\%; 9-45). Interpretation: Adults in rural Kenya face a combined burden of infectious diseases, pregnancy-related disorders, cardiovascular illnesses, and injuries. Disease burden estimates based on hospital data are affected by distance from the hospital, and the amount of underestimation of disease burden differs by both disease and sex. © 2014 Etyang et al.},

	abstract = {Objective: Young women bear the greatest burden of sexually transmitted infections ({STIs}), so it is important to identify and address barriers to {STI} screening in this population. We conducted a qualitative study to explore the feasibility of {STI} screening among adolescent girls and young women in Mombasa, Kenya. Methods: We conducted 17 in-depth interviews ({IDIs}) (8 with adolescent girls and 9 with young women) and 6 focus group discussions ({FGDs}) (4 with adolescent girls and 2 with young women, total 55 participants). The audio recordings for the {IDIs} and {FGDs} were translated and transcribed into English. Transcripts were independently reviewed by two researchers, and a set of codes was designed to help analyze the data using the content analysis approach. Data content was then analyzed manually and digitally using {ATLAS}. ti, and consensus was reached on central and specific emergent themes discussed by the research team. Results: Adolescent girls and young women in Mombasa, Kenya expressed willingness to participate in {STI} screening. A major incentive for screening was participants' desire to know their {STI} status, especially following perceived high-risk sexual behavior. Lack of symptoms and fear of positive test results were identified as barriers to {STI} screening at the individual level, while parental notification and stigmatization from parents, family members and the community were identified as barriers at the community level. Uncomfortable or embarrassing methods of specimen collection were an additional barrier. Thus, urine-based screening was felt to be the most acceptable. Conclusion: Kenyan adolescent girls and young women seem willing to participate in screening for {STIs} using urine testing. Addressing stigmatization by parents, health care workers and the community could further facilitate {STI} screening in this population. © 2017 Avuvika et al.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}:: Little is known about the need and demand for integrated reproductive health and {HIV} services at the population level. {DESIGN}:: Descriptive data analysis of household surveys collected by the Integra Initiative. {METHODS}:: Household surveys were conducted among 18-49-year-olds in Kenya (Nâ€Š=â€Š1752) and Swaziland (Nâ€Š=â€Š779) in 2009. Data on fertility intentions, contraceptive use, sexual behaviours and {HIV} testing were used to determine unmet needs. Demand for integrated services was defined as wanting reproductive health services with {HIV}/sexually transmitted infection ({STI}) services within one visit. {RESULTS}:: At the population level, family planning needs (90\%) were higher than {HIV}/{STI} prevention needs: 53\% (women) and 75\% (men). Fewer had unmet family planning needs through non-use of contraceptives: 17\% (women) and 27\% (men); versus unmet {HIV}/{STI} prevention needs through inconsistent condom use: 48 and 26\% of women; 51 and 32\% of men in Kenya and Swaziland, respectively. Dual need was higher for men: 64\% (Kenya) and 73\% (Swaziland) versus women (48\%) with more unmet in Kenya (43\%) compared to Swaziland (25\%). Missed opportunities for integrated service provision were high among women: 49 and 57\% with unmet family planning needs; and 55 and 32\% with unmet {HIV}/{STI} prevention needs in Kenya and Swaziland, respectively, used services, but did not receive the needed service. Most men with unmet needs were non-service users. Approximately a quarter of women wanted and received integrated reproductive health-{HIV}/{STI} services in both countries. {CONCLUSIONS}:: Demand creation at the community level and provider-initiated integrated service provision are needed, using different strategies for men and women, to address substantial family planning and {HIV}/{STI} prevention needs. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health {\textbar} Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

	abstract = {Introduction. Equitable access to health care is a key health systems goal, and is a particular concern in low-income countries. In Kenya, public facilities are an important resource for the poor, but little is known on the equity of service provision. This paper assesses whether poorer areas have poorer health services by investigating associations between public facility characteristics and the poverty level of the area in which the facility is located. Methods. Data on facility characteristics were collected from a nationally representative sample of public health centers and dispensaries across all 8 provinces in Kenya. A two-stage cluster randomized sampling process was used to select facilities. Univariate associations between facility characteristics and socioeconomic status ({SES}) of the area in which the facility was located were assessed using chi-squared tests, equity ratios and concentration indices. Indirectly standardized concentration indices were used to assess the influence of {SES} on facility inputs and service availability while controlling for facility type, province, and remoteness. Results: For most indicators, we found no indication of variation by {SES}. The clear exceptions were electricity and laboratory services which showed evidence of pro-rich inequalities, with equity ratios of 3.16 and 3.43, concentration indices of 0.09 (p{\textless}0.01) and 0.05 (p=0.01), and indirectly standardized concentration ratios of 0.07 (p{\textless}0.01) and 0.05 (p=0.01). There were also some indications of pro-rich inequalities for availability of drugs and qualified staff. The lack of evidence of inequality for other indicators does not imply that availability of inputs and services was invariably high; for example, while availability was close to 90\% for water supply and family planning services, under half of facilities offered delivery services or outreach. Conclusions: The paper shows how local area poverty data can be combined with national health facility surveys, providing a tool for policy makers to assess the equity of input and service availability. There was little evidence of inequalities for most inputs and services, with the clear exceptions of electricity and laboratory services. However, efforts are required to improve the availability of key inputs and services across public facilities in all areas, regardless of {SES}. © 2012 Toda et al.},

	abstract = {A rights-based approach in {HIV} service delivery for adults is increasingly taking root in sub-Saharan Africa in the context of greater availability of antiretroviral therapy. Yet there has been comparatively little progress in strengthening a rights-based approach to adolescent {HIV} services, which we learned during a qualitative study in 2010 among 111 adolescents living with {HIV}, 21 parents and 38 health providers in three districts in Zambia. Adolescents in the study expressed a range of information and support needs and wanted locally relevant interventions to meet those needs. They wanted greater access to {HIV}, sexual and reproductive health information, information on how to protect themselves, privacy and confidentiality in service sites, skills training so as to be able to earn money, and better control over disclosure of their {HIV} status to others. Both health workers and parents acknowledged that information and services needed to be improved to meet those needs far better. This paper provides examples of successful programmes in Zimbabwe, Uganda, Tanzania, Botswana and South Africa and calls for adolescent services to be linked to both paediatric and adult services, peer networks to be established to increase adolescents' ability to collectively voice their concerns and support each other, interventions supporting adolescents' control over self-disclosure, and lastly that adolescent health should become a training specialty in sub-Saharan Africa. © 2013 Reproductive Health Matters.},

Despite these internationally recognised standards, access to {RH} services is still often compromised in war. We assessed the effectiveness of our programme in northern Uganda to provide family planning ({FP}) services through mobile outreach and public health centre strengthening. Baseline (n=905) and endline (n=873) cross-sectional surveys using a multistage cluster sampling design were conducted in the catchment areas of four public health centres in 2007 and 2010. Current use of any modern {FP} method increased from 7.1\% to 22.6\% (adjusted odds ratio [{OR}] 3.34 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 2.27-4.92]); current use of long-acting and permanent methods increased from 1.2\% to 9.8\% (adjusted {OR} 9.45 [95\%{CI} 3.99-22.39]). The proportion of women with unmet need for {FP} decreased from 52.1\% to 35.7\%. This study demonstrates that when comprehensive {FP} services are provided among conflict-affected populations, women will choose to use them. The combination of mobile teams and health systems strengthening can make a full range of methods quickly available while supporting the health system to continue to provide those services in challenging and resource-constrained settings. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, {LLC}.},

	abstract = {Background: Definitions of advanced nursing practice abound, yet little has been published concerning the context for advanced nursing in sub-Saharan Africa. This study set out to explore the existence of, and potential for, advanced nursing practice in Kenya. Methods: Ten nurses were invited to participate in semi-structured qualitative interviews. Participants were purposively selected to provide insight into the practice of experienced nurses in urban, rural, community, hospital, public and private health care settings. Interview narratives were recorded, transcribed and subsequently analysed using a thematic approach. Results: All participants reported that they were engaged in the delivery of expert, evidence-based care. The majority also undertook administrative activities, teaching in the practice area and policy and practice advocacy. However, only the two private practice nurses interviewed during the study were working with the level of autonomy that might be expected of advanced nurse practitioners. Conclusions: While participants were undertaking many of the activities associated with advanced nursing roles, advanced nursing practice as widely understood in the (largely western derived) international literature was not identified. The nurses practicing with the greatest autonomy were generally those with the lowest educational qualifications rather than the highest. Highly qualified nurses and midwives tend to move into management and education, and see little opportunity for advancement while remaining in clinical practice. It is notable that, although a growing number of universities offer master's level education, no African countries have yet regulated an advanced level of practice. The existence of the physician substitute 'clinical officer' cadre in Kenya, as in other Sub-Saharan African countries, suggests that the development of the advanced nurse practitioner role is unlikely at present. However, there is a pressing need for advanced nurses and midwives who can implement evidence-based practice and exercise clinical leadership in the drive to attain the Millennium Development Goals and their post-2015 successors. © 2014 East et al.},

The idea of {UHC} is rooted in the right to health, set out in the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. Based on the Covenant and the General Comment of the Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, which is responsible for interpreting and monitoring the Covenant, we identify 6 key legal principles that should underpin {UHC} based on the right to health: minimum core obligation, progressive realization, cost-effectiveness, shared responsibility, participatory decision making, and prioritizing vulnerable or marginalized groups. Yet, although these principles are widely accepted, they are criticized for not being specific enough to operationalize as post-2015 indicators for reaching the target of {UHC}. In this article, we propose measurable and achievable indicators for {UHC} based on the right to health that can be used to inform the ongoing negotiations on Sustainable Development Goals. However, we identify 3 major challenges that face any exercise in setting indicators post-2015: data availability as an essential criterion, the universality of targets, and the adaptation of global goals to local populations. © 2015 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background In Tanzania, maternal mortality ratio ({MMR}), unmet need for emergency obstetric care and health inequities across the country are in a critical state, particularly in rural areas. This study was established to determine the feasibility and impact of decentralizing comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care ({CEmONC}) services in underserved rural areas using associate clinicians. Methods Ten health centres ({HCs}) were upgraded by constructing and equipping maternity blocks, operating rooms, laboratories, staff houses and installing solar panels, standby generators and water supply systems. Twenty-three assistant medical officers (advanced level associate clinicians), and forty-four nurse-midwives and clinical officers (associate clinicians) were trained in {CEmONC} and anaesthesia respectively. {CEmONC} services were launched between 2009 and 2012. Monthly supportive supervision and clinical audits of adverse pregnancy outcomes were introduced in 2011 in these {HCs} and their respective district hospitals. Findings After launching {CEmONC} services from 2009 to 2014 institutional deliveries increased in all upgraded rural {HCs}. Mean numbers of monthly deliveries increased by 151\% and obstetric referrals decreased from 9\% to 3\% (p = 0.03) in {HCs}. A total of 43,846 deliveries and 2,890 caesarean sections ({CS}) were performed in these {HCs} making the mean proportion of all births in {EmONC} facilities of 128\% and mean population-based {CS} rate of 9\%. There were 190 maternal deaths and 1,198 intrapartum and very early neonatal deaths ({IVEND}) in all health facilities. Generally, health centres had statistically significantly lower maternal mortality ratios and {IVEND} rates than district hospitals (p {\textless} 0.00 and {\textless} 0.02 respectively). Of all deaths (maternal and {IVEND}) 84\% to 96\% were considered avoidable. Conclusions These findings strongly indicate that remotely located health centres in resource limited settings hold a great potential to increase accessibility to {CEmONC} services and to improve maternal and perinatal health. © 2016 Nyamtema et al.

Recent data suggest that the main reason for unmet need is not lack of access, but fear of and unacceptability of side effects. In this qualitative study, 46 women and men were interviewed about their experience of injectable contraceptive side effects and the consequences for their lives. Thirty-two family planning service providers and policymakers were also interviewed on their perceptions. While using injectables, many of the women experienced menstrual irregularities and loss of libido. Both women and men experienced strained sexual relationships and expressed fear of infertility, often resulting in contraceptive discontinuation. Family planning service providers and policymakers often minimized side effects as compared to the risks of unintended pregnancy. Policymakers noted a lack of contraceptive alternatives and promoted family planning education to correct what they thought were misconceptions about side effects among both service providers and contraceptive users. Information alone, however, cannot diminish disturbances to social and sexual relationships. A common understanding of recognised side effects, not only with injectables but all contraceptives, is necessary if unmet need in Uganda is to be reduced. © 2012 Reproductive Health Matters.},

	abstract = {Background Surgery is increasingly recognized as an important driver for health systems strengthening, especially in developing countries. To facilitate quality improvement initiatives, baseline knowledge of capacity for surgical, anaesthetic, emergency and obstetric care is critical. In partnership with the Malawi Ministry of Health, we quantified government hospitals' surgical capacity through workforce, infrastructure and health service delivery components. Methods From November 2012 to January 2013, we surveyed district and mission hospital administrators and clinical staff onsite using a modified version of the Personnel, Infrastructure, Procedures, Equipment and Supplies ({PIPES}) tool from Surgeons {OverSeas}. We calculated percentage of facilities demonstrating adequacy of the assessed components, surgical case rates, operating theatre density and surgical workforce density. Results Twenty-seven government hospitals were surveyed (90\% of the district hospitals, all central hospitals). Of the surgical workforce surveyed (n = 370), 92.7\% were non-surgeons and 77\% were clinical officers ({COs}). Of the 109 anaesthesia providers, 95.4\% were non-physician anaesthetists (anaesthesia {COs} or {ACOs}). Non-surgeons and {ACOs} were the only providers of surgical services and anaesthetic services in 85\% and 88.9\% of hospitals, respectively. No specialists served the district hospitals. All of the hospitals experienced periods without external electricity. Most did not always have a functioning generator (78.3\% district, 25\% central) or running water (82.6\%, 50\%). None of the district hospitals had an Intensive Care Unit ({ICU}). Cricothyroidotomy, bowel resection and cholecystectomy were not done in over two-thirds of hospitals. Every hospital provided general anaesthesia but some did not always have a functioning anaesthesia machine (52.2\%, 50\%). Surgical rate, operating theatre density and surgical workforce density per 100 000 population was 289.48-747.38 procedures, 0.98 and 5.41 and 3.68 surgical providers, respectively. Conclusion {COs} form the backbone of Malawi's surgical and anaesthetic workforce and should be supported with improvements in infrastructure as well as training and mentorship by specialist surgeons and anaesthetists. © 2014 Published by Oxford University Press in association with The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.},

	abstract = {Background: Progress towards reaching Millennium Development Goals four (child health) and five (maternal health) is lagging behind, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, despite increasing efforts to scale up high impact interventions. Increasing the proportion of birth attended by a skilled attendant is a main indicator of progress, but not much is known about the quality of childbirth care delivered by these skilled attendants. With a view to reducing maternal mortality through health systems improvement we describe the care routinely offered in childbirth at dispensaries, health centres and hospitals in five districts in rural Southern Tanzania. We use data from a health facility census assessing 159 facilities in five districts in early 2009. A structural and operational assessment was undertaken based on staff reports using a modular questionnaire assessing staffing, work load, equipment and supplies as well as interventions routinely implemented during childbirth. Results: Health centres and dispensaries attended a median of eight and four deliveries every month respectively. Dispensaries had a median of 2.5 ({IQR} 2-3) health workers including auxiliary staff instead of the recommended four clinical officer and certified nurses. Only 28\% of first-line facilities (dispensaries and health centres) reported offering active management in the third stage of labour ({AMTSL}). Essential childbirth care comprising eight interventions including {AMTSL}, infection prevention, partograph use including foetal monitoring and newborn care including early breastfeeding, thermal care at birth and prevention of ophthalmia neonatorum was offered by 5\% of dispensaries, 38\% of health centres and 50\% of hospitals consistently. No first-line facility had provided all signal functions for emergency obstetric complications in the previous six months. Conclusions: Essential interventions for childbirth care are not routinely implemented in first-line facilities or hospitals. Dispensaries have both low staffing and low caseload which constrains the ability to provide high-quality childbirth care. Improvements in quality of care are essential so that women delivering in facility receive "skilled attendance" and adequate care for common obstetric complications such as post-partum haemorrhage. © 2013 Hanson et al.; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Institutional delivery is one of the key and proven strategies to reduce maternal deaths. Since the 1990s, the government of India has made substantial investment on maternal care to reduce the huge burden of maternal deaths in the country. However, despite the effort access to institutional delivery in India remains below the global average. In addition, even in places where health investments have been comparable, inter- and intra-state difference in access to maternal care services remain wide and substantial. This raises a fundamental question on whether the sub-national units themselves differ in terms of the efficiency with which they use available resources, and if so, why? Methods: Data obtained from round 3 of the country's District Level Health and Facility Survey was analyzed to measure the level and determinants of inefficiency of institutional delivery in the country. Analysis was conducted using spatial stochastic frontier models that correct for heterogeneity and spatial interactions between sub-national units. Results: Inefficiency differences in maternal care services between and within states are substantial. The top one third of districts in the country has a mean efficiency score of 90 per cent or more, while the bottom 10 per cent of districts exhibit mean inefficiency score of as high as over 75 per cent or more. Overall mean inefficiency is about 30 per cent. The result also reveals the existence of both heterogeneity and spatial correlation in institutional delivery in the country. Conclusions: Given the high level of inefficiency in the system, further progress in improving coverage of institutional delivery in the country should focus both on improving the efficiency of resource utilization - especially where inefficiency levels are extremely high - and on bringing new resources in to the system. The additional investment should specifically focus on those parts of the country where coverage rates are still low but efficiency levels are already at a high level. In addition, given that inefficiency was also associated inversely with literacy and urbanization and positively related with proportion of households belonging to poor households, investment in these areas can also improve coverage of institutional delivery in the country. © 2015 Kinfu and Sawhney; licensee {BioMed} Central.},

	abstract = {Background: In countries with high maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality, reliable access to quality healthcare in rural areas is essential to save lives. Health workers who are satisfied with their jobs are more likely to remain in rural posts. Understanding what factors influence health workers' satisfaction can help determine where resources should be focused. Although there is a growing body of research assessing health worker satisfaction in hospitals, less is known about health worker satisfaction in rural, primary health clinics. This study explores the workplace satisfaction of health workers in primary health clinics in rural Tanzania. Methods: Overall, 70 health workers in rural Tanzania participated in a self-administered job satisfaction survey. We calculated mean ratings for 17 aspects of the work environment. We used principal components analysis ({PCA}) to identify groupings of these variables. We then examined the bivariate associations between health workers demographics and clinic characteristics and each of the satisfaction scales. Results: Results showed that 73.9\% of health workers strongly agreed that they were satisfied with their job; however, only 11.6\% strongly agreed that they were satisfied with their level of pay and 2.9\% with the availability of equipment and supplies. Two categories of factors emerged from the {PCA}: the tools and infrastructure to provide care, and supportive interpersonal environment. Nurses and medical attendants (compared to clinical officers) and older health workers had higher satisfaction scale ratings. Conclusions: Two dimensions of health workers' work environment, namely infrastructure and supportive interpersonal work environment, explained much of the variation in satisfaction among rural Tanzanian health workers in primary health clinics. Health workers were generally more satisfied with supportive interpersonal relationships than with the infrastructure. Human resource policies should consider how to improve these two aspects of work as a means for improving health worker morale and potentially rural attrition.

Recent reports state that faith-based organizations play a substantial role in providing healthcare in developing countries, cited in some publications as up to 70\% of all healthcare services. The data behind these numbers are sometimes difficult to pinpoint and seem at odds to national and regional survey data. In an effort to quantify the contribution of faith-based organizations to healthcare delivery in low- and middle-income countries, we undertook a systematic review of the literature and conducted a new analysis of relevant Demographic and Health Survey data from 47 countries. Our findings demonstrate that the magnitude of healthcare provided by faith-based organizations may be lower than previously estimated.

We assessed the effect of transitioning from paper-based to an {EMR}-based system on appropriate placement on {ART} among eligible patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, pre-post {EMR} study among patients enrolled in {HIV} care and eligible for {ART} at 17 rural Kenyan clinics and compared the: (1) proportion of patients eligible for {ART} based on {CD}4 count or {WHO} staging who initiate therapy; (2) time from eligibility for {ART} to {ART} initiation; (3) time from {ART} initiation to first {CD}4 test. Results: 7298 patients were eligible for {ART}; 54.8\% (n=3998) were enrolled in {HIV} care using a paper-based system while 45.2\% (n=3300) were enrolled after the implementation of the {EMR}. {EMR} was independently associated with a 22\% increase in the odds of initiating {ART} among eligible patients (adjusted {OR} ({aOR}) 1.22, 95\% {CI} 1.12 to 1.33). The proportion of {ART}-eligible patients not receiving {ART} was 20.3\% and 15.1\% for paper and {EMR}, respectively (χ2=33.5, p{\textless}0.01). Median time from {ART} eligibility to {ART} initiation was 29.1 days ({IQR}: 14.1-62.1) for paper compared to 27 days ({IQR}: 12.9-50.1) for {EMR}.

	abstract = {{AIM}: To critically evaluate the current epidemiology data on exposures, rather than infection, to hepatitis C virus ({HCV}) transmission and recommend epidemiologic strategies to fill gaps. {METHODS}: Standard methods for identifying and evaluating relevant epidemiologic literature and available data were used. {RESULTS}: There is a large body of literature on the epidemiology of {HCV} transmission in Egypt that collectively identifies ongoing iatrogenic exposures as the major driver for {HCV} transmission due to short comings in infection control and standard procedures. Additional epidemiologic studies on {HCV} transmission that requires the participation of human subject is unwarranted. Alternatively, very little literature was found on the epidemiology of exposure to {HCV}, infection control, and safe injection practices. The information that is available on patterns of {HCV} exposure shows high frequencies of inadequate infection control, problems in sterilization in health care facilities, low rates of hand washing, untrained personnel, lack of stated policies in facilities, {HCV} contamination of instruments and very large injection frequencies with low but very significant syringe and needle reuse. There is an important need to increase the number, size, and diversity of epidemiologic studies on {HCV} exposures, patterns of risk factors for infection, infection control, and safe injection practices. In addition to health care facilities evaluation, relevant knowledge attitude and practice studies are recommended. {CONCLUSION}: Epidemiologic methods on {HCV} exposure can be used to characterize the magnitude of exposures to {HCV} infection, target interventions to reduce exposures, and provide the best method for evaluating interventions by demonstrating the reduction of exposure to {HCV} infection. © The Author(s) 2015.

Methods: We reviewed reports from several meetings of the working group on health systems strengthening of the Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care, and also performed a review of the literature including the search terms "surgery," "health system," "developing country," "health systems strengthening," "health information system," "financing," "governance," and "integration." Results: The literature search revealed no reports which focused on the integration of surgical services within a health system or as a component of health system strengthening. A conceptual model of how surgical care might be integrated within a health system is proposed, based on the discussions of our working group, combined with sources from the medical literature, and utilizing the World Health Organization's conceptual model of a health system. Conclusions: Strengthening the delivery of surgical services in {LMICs} will require inputs at multiple levels within a health system, and this effort will require the coalescence of committed individuals and organizations, supported by civil society. © 2015 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.},

Methods: Caretaker rated {PQC} for children aged (2-59) months treated by either {CHWs} or {PHFWs} for a bought of malaria, pneumonia or diarrhoea was cross-sectionally compared in quality domains of accessibility, continuity, comprehensiveness, integration, clinical interaction, interpersonal treatment and trust. Child samples were randomly drawn from {CHW} (419) and clinic (399) records from eight Midwestern Uganda districts. An overall {PQC} score was predicted through factor analysis. {PQC} scores were compared for {CHWs} and {PHFWs} using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to specify the association between categorized {PQC} and service providers for each quality domain. Finally, overall {PQC} was dichotomized into "high" and "low" based on median score and relative risks ({RR}) for {PQC}-service provider association were modeled in a "modified" Poisson regression model. Results: Mean ({SD}) overall {PQC} was significantly higher for {CHWs} 0.58 (0 .66) compared to {PHFWs} -0.58 (0.94), p{\textless}0.0001. In "modified" Poisson regression, the proportion of caretakers reporting high {PQC} was higher for {CHWS} compared to {PHFWs}, {RR}=3.1, 95\%{CI}(2.5-3.8). In multinomial models {PQC} was significantly higher for {CHWs} compared to {PHFWs} in all domains except for continuity. Conclusion: {PQC} was significantly higher for {CHWs} compared to {PHFWs} in this resource constrained setting. {CHWs} should be tapped human resources for universal health coverage while scaling up basic child intervention as {PQC} might improve intervention utilization. © 2013 Nanyonjo et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Maternal and newborn mortality remain unacceptably high in sub-Saharan Africa. Tanzania and Uganda are committed to reduce maternal and newborn mortality, but progress has been limited and many essential interventions are unavailable in primary and referral facilities. Quality management has the potential to overcome low implementation levels by assisting teams of health workers and others finding local solutions to problems in delivering quality care and the underutilization of health services by the community. Existing evidence of the effect of quality management on health worker performance in these contexts has important limitations, and the feasibility of expanding quality management to the community level is unknown. We aim to assess quality management at the district, facility, and community levels, supported by information from high-quality, continuous surveys, and report effects of the quality management intervention on the utilization and quality of services in Tanzania and Uganda.Methods: In Uganda and Tanzania, the Expanded Quality Management Using Information Power ({EQUIP}) intervention is implemented in one intervention district and evaluated using a plausibility design with one non-randomly selected comparison district. The quality management approach is based on the collaborative model for improvement, in which groups of quality improvement teams test new implementation strategies (change ideas) and periodically meet to share results and identify the best strategies. The teams use locally-generated community and health facility data to monitor improvements. In addition, data from continuous health facility and household surveys are used to guide prioritization and decision making by quality improvement teams as well as for evaluation of the intervention. These data include input, process, output, coverage, implementation practice, and client satisfaction indicators in both intervention and comparison districts. Thus, intervention districts receive quality management and continuous surveys, and comparison districts-only continuous surveys.Discussion: {EQUIP} is a district-scale, proof-of-concept study that evaluates a quality management approach for maternal and newborn health including communities, health facilities, and district health managers, supported by high-quality data from independent continuous household and health facility surveys. The study will generate robust evidence about the effectiveness of quality management and will inform future nationwide implementation approaches for health system strengthening in low-resource settings.Trial registration: {PACTR}201311000681314. © 2014 Hanson et al.; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Several years in advance of the 2015 endpoint for the Millennium Development Goals ({MDGs}), Malawi was already thought to be one of the few countries in sub-Saharan Africa likely to meet the {MDG} 4 target of reducing under-5 mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. Countdown to 2015 therefore selected the Malawi National Statistical Office to lead an in-depth country case study, aimed mainly at explaining the country's success in improving child survival. Methods: We estimated child and neonatal mortality for the years 2000-14 using five district-representative household surveys. The study included recalculation of coverage indicators for that period, and used the Lives Saved Tool ({LiST}) to attribute the child lives saved in the years from 2000 to 2013 to various interventions. We documented the adoption and implementation of policies and programmes affecting the health of women and children, and developed estimates of financing. Findings: The estimated mortality rate in children younger than 5 years declined substantially in the study period, from 247 deaths (90\% {CI} 234-262) per 1000 livebirths in 1990 to 71 deaths (58-83) in 2013, with an annual rate of decline of 5·4\%. The most rapid mortality decline occurred in the 1-59 months age group; neonatal mortality declined more slowly (from 50 to 23 deaths per 1000 livebirths), representing an annual rate of decline of 3·3\%. Nearly half of the coverage indicators have increased by more than 20 percentage points between 2000 and 2014. Results from the {LiST} analysis show that about 280 000 children's lives were saved between 2000 and 2013, attributable to interventions including treatment for diarrhoea, pneumonia, and malaria (23\%), insecticide-treated bednets (20\%), vaccines (17\%), reductions in wasting (11\%) and stunting (9\%), facility birth care (7\%), and prevention and treatment of {HIV} (7\%). The amount of funding allocated to the health sector has increased substantially, particularly to child health and {HIV} and from external sources, but remains below internationally agreed targets. Key policies to address the major causes of child mortality and deliver high-impact interventions at scale throughout Malawi began in the late 1990s and intensified in the latter half of the 2000s and into the 2010s, backed by health-sector-wide policies to improve women's and children's health. Interpretation: This case study confirmed that Malawi had achieved {MDG} 4 for child survival by 2013. Our findings suggest that this was achieved mainly through the scale-up of interventions that are effective against the major causes of child deaths (malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhoea), programmes to reduce child undernutrition and mother-to-child transmission of {HIV}, and some improvements in the quality of care provided around birth. The Government of Malawi was among the first in sub-Saharan Africa to adopt evidence-based policies and implement programmes at scale to prevent unnecessary child deaths. Much remains to be done, building on this success and extending it to higher proportions of the population and targeting continued high neonatal mortality rates.

	abstract = {Background: Despite indications that infection-related mortality in sub-Saharan Africa may be decreasing and the burden of non-communicable diseases increasing, the overwhelming reality is that health information systems across most of sub-Saharan Africa remain too weak to track epidemiological transition in a meaningful and effective way. Proposals: We propose a minimum dataset as the basis of a functional health information system in countries where health information is lacking. This would involve continuous monitoring of cause-specific mortality through routine civil registration, regular documentation of exposure to leading risk factors, and monitoring effective coverage of key preventive and curative interventions in the health sector. Consideration must be given as to how these minimum data requirements can be effectively integrated within national health information systems, what methods and tools are needed, and ensuring that ethical and political issues are addressed. A more strategic approach to health information systems in sub-Saharan African countries, along these lines, is essential if epidemiological changes are to be tracked effectively for the benefit of local health planners and policy makers. Conclusion: African countries have a unique opportunity to capitalize on modern information and communications technology in order to achieve this. Methodological standards need to be established and political momentum fostered so that the African continent's health status can be reliably tracked. This will greatly strengthen the evidence base for health policies and facilitate the effective delivery of services. © 2014 Peter Byass et al.},

	abstract = {Background: The majority of maternal deaths, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths are concentrated in a few countries, many of which have weak health systems, poor access to health services, and low coverage of key health interventions. Early and consistent antenatal care ({ANC}) attendance could significantly reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Despite this, most Kenyan mothers initiate {ANC} care late in pregnancy and attend fewer than the recommended visits.Methods: We used survey data from 6,200 pregnant women across six districts in western Kenya to understand demand-side factors related to use of {ANC}. Bayesian multi-level models were developed to explore the relative importance of individual, household and village-level factors in relation to {ANC} use.Results: There is significant spatial autocorrelation of {ANC} attendance in three of the six districts and considerable heterogeneity in factors related to {ANC} use between districts. Working outside the home limited {ANC} attendance. Maternal age, the number of small children in the household, and ownership of livestock were important in some districts, but not all. Village proportions of pregnancy in women of child-bearing age was significantly correlated to {ANC} use in three of the six districts. Geographic distance to health facilities and the type of nearest facility was not correlated with {ANC} use. After incorporating individual, household and village-level covariates, no residual spatial autocorrelation remained in the outcome.Conclusions: {ANC} attendance was consistently low across all the districts, but factors related to poor attendance varied. This heterogeneity is expected for an outcome that is highly influenced by socio-cultural values and local context. Interventions to improve use of {ANC} must be tailored to local context and should include explicit approaches to reach women who work outside the home. © 2013 Prudhomme O'Meara et al.; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Evaluating health systems and policy ({HSP}) change and implementation is critical in understanding reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health ({RMNCH}) progress within and across countries. Whilst data for health outcomes, coverage and equity have advanced in the last decade, comparable analyses of {HSP} changes are lacking. We present a set of novel tools developed by Countdown to 2015 (Countdown) to systematically analyse and describe {HSP} change for {RMNCH} indicators, enabling multi-country comparisons. Methods: International experts worked with eight country teams to develop {HSP} tools via mixed methods. These tools assess {RMNCH} change over time (e.g. 1990-2015) and include: (i) Policy and Programme Timeline Tool (depicting change according to level of policy); (ii) Health Policy Tracer Indicators Dashboard (showing 11 selected {RMNCH} policies over time); (iii) Health Systems Tracer Indicators Dashboard (showing four selected systems indicators over time); and (iv) Programme implementation assessment. To illustrate these tools, we present results from Tanzania and Peru, two of eight Countdown case studies. Results: The Policy and Programme Timeline tool shows that Tanzania's {RMNCH} environment is complex, with increased funding and programmes for child survival, particularly primary-care implementation. Maternal health was prioritised since mid-1990s, yet with variable programme implementation, mainly targeting facilities. Newborn health only received attention since 2005, yet is rapidly scaling-up interventions at facility- and community-levels. Reproductive health lost momentum, with re-investment since 2010. Contrastingly, Peru moved from standalone to integrated {RMNCH} programme implementation, combined with multi-sectoral, anti-poverty strategies. The {HSP} Tracer Indicators Dashboards show that Peru has adopted nine of 11 policy tracer indicators and Tanzania has adopted seven. Peru costed national {RMNCH} plans pre-2000, whereas Tanzania developed a national {RMNCH} plan in 2006 but only costed the reproductive health component. Both countries included all lifesaving {RMNCH} commodities on their essential medicines lists. Peru has twice the health worker density of Tanzania (15.4 vs. 7.1/10,000 population, respectively), although both are below the 22.8 {WHO} minimum threshold. Conclusions: These are the first {HSP} tools using mixed methods to systematically analyse and describe {RMNCH} changes within and across countries, important in informing accelerated progress for ending preventable maternal, newborn and child mortality in the post-2015 era. © 2016 The Author(s).},

Currently, few sources exist which can provide canonical identification of health care facilities. Furthermore, quantifying facility-specific services and infrastructure in a standard manner ranges from insufficient to nonexistent. A health facility registry ({FR}) provides a central authority to store, manage, and share health facility identification, services, and resources data with a wide range of stakeholders. Such universal collection and standardization of these data may support care coordination, public health responsiveness, quality improvement, health services research, health service planning, and health policy development.

This study assessed integrated paediatric fever management using malaria rapid diagnostic tests ({RDT}) and Integrated Management of Childhood Illness ({IMCI}) guidelines, including the relationship between {RDT}-negative results and antibiotic over-treatment in Malawi health facilities in 2013-2014. Methods: A Malawi national facility census included 1981 observed sick children aged 2-59 months with fever complaints. Weighted frequencies were tabulated for other complaints, assessments and prescriptions for {RDT}-confirmed malaria, {IMCI}-classified non-severe pneumonia, and clinical diarrhoea. Classification trees using model-based recursive partitioning estimated the association between {RDT} results and antibiotic over-treatment and learned the influence of 38 other input variables at patient-, provider- and facility-levels. Results: Among 1981 clients, 72 \% were tested or referred for malaria diagnosis and 85 \% with {RDT}-confirmed malaria were prescribed first-line anti-malarials. Twenty-eight percent with {IMCI}-pneumonia were not prescribed antibiotics (under-treatment) and 59 \% 'without antibiotic need' were prescribed antibiotics (over-treatment). Few clients had respiratory rates counted to identify antibiotic need for {IMCI}-pneumonia (18 \%). {RDT}-negative children had 16.8 (95 \% {CI} 8.6-32.7) times higher antibiotic over-treatment odds compared to {RDT}-positive cases conditioned by cough or difficult breathing complaints. Conclusions: Integrated paediatric fever management was sub-optimal for completed assessments and antibiotic targeting despite common compliance to malaria treatment guidelines. {RDT}-negative results were strongly associated with antibiotic over-treatment conditioned by cough or difficult breathing complaints. A shift from malaria-focused 'test and treat' strategies toward '{IMCI} with testing' is needed to improve quality fever care and rational use of both anti-malarials and antibiotics in line with recent global commitments to combat resistance. © 2016 The Author(s).},

We conducted a randomized controlled trial with pregnant women in Nairobi, Kenya, to analyze whether cash transfers, enhanced with behavioral "nudges," can help women deliver in facilities that are consistent with their preferences and are of higher quality.We tested two interventions. The first was a labeled cash transfer ({LCT}), which explained that the cash was to help women deliver where they wanted. The second was a cash transfer that combined labeling and a commitment by the recipient to deliver in a prespecified desired facility as a condition of receiving the final payment (L-{CCT}). The L-{CCT} improved patient-perceived quality of interpersonal care but not perceived technical quality of care. It also increased women's likelihood of delivering in facilities that met standards for routine and emergency newborn care but not the likelihood of delivering in facilities that met standards for obstetric care. The {LCT} had fewer measured benefits. Women preferred facilities with high technical and interpersonal care quality, but these quality measures were often negatively correlated within facilities. Even with cash transfers, many women still used poor-quality facilities. A larger study is warranted to determine whether the L-{CCT} can improve maternal and newborn outcomes. © 2017 Project {HOPE}- The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.},

	abstract = {{HIV} testing and counselling forms the gateway to the {HIV} care and treatment continuum. Therefore, the World Health Organization recommends provider-initiated testing and counselling ({PITC}) in countries with a generalized {HIV} epidemic. Few studies have investigated linkage-to-{HIV}-care among out-patients after {PITC}. Our objective was to study timely linkage-to-{HIV}-care in six Rwandan health facilities ({HFs}) before and after the introduction of {PITC} in the out-patient departments ({OPDs}). Information from patients diagnosed with {HIV} was abstracted from voluntary counselling and testing, {OPD} and laboratory registers of six Rwandan {HFs} during three-month periods before (March–May 2009) and after (December 2009–February 2010) the introduction of {PITC} in the {OPDs} of these facilities. Information on patients’ subsequent linkage-to-pre-antiretroviral therapy ({ART}) care and {ART} was abstracted from {ART} clinic registers of each {HF}. To triangulate the findings from {HF} routine, a survey was held among patients to assess reasons for non-enrolment. Of 635 patients with an {HIV} diagnosis, 232 (36.5\%) enrolled at the {ART} clinic within 90 days of diagnosis. Enrolment among out-patients decreased after the introduction of {PITC} (adjusted odds ratio, 2.0; 95\% confidence interval, 1.0–4.2; p =.051). Survey findings showed that retesting for {HIV} among patients already diagnosed and enrolled into care was not uncommon. Patients reported non-acceptance of disease status, stigma and problems with healthcare services as main barriers for enrolment. Timely linkage-to-{HIV}-care was suboptimal in this Rwandan study before and after the introduction of {PITC}; the introduction of {PITC} in the {OPD} may have had a negative impact on linkage-to-{HIV}-care. Healthier patients tested through {PITC} might be less ready to engage in {HIV} care. Fear of {HIV} stigma and mistrust of test results appear to be at the root of these problems. © 2016 Informa {UK} Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Despite the expansion of literature on social accountability in low-and middle-income countries, little is known about how health providers experience daily social pressure and citizen feedback. This study used a narrative inquiry approach to explore the function of daily social accountability relations among maternal health care workers in rural Malawi. Through semi-structured interviews with 32 nurses and 19 clinicians, we collected 155 feedback cases allowing the identification of four main strategies social actors use to express their opinion and concerns about maternal health services. We found that women who used delivery care express their appreciation for successful deliveries directly to the health worker but complaints, such as on absenteeism and poor interpersonal behaviour, follow an indirect route via intermediaries such as the health workers’ spouse, co-workers or the health committee who forward some cases of misbehaviour to district authorities. The findings suggest that citizen feedback is important for the socialization, motivation and retention of maternal healthcare workers in under resourced rural settings. Practitioners and external development programmes should understand and recognize the value of already existing accountability mechanisms and foster social accountability approaches that allow communities as well as health workers to challenge the systemic obstacles to quality and respectful service delivery. © 2018 Lodenstein et al.

	abstract = {Background: There is limited evidence on how health care inputs are distributed from the sub-national level down to health facilities and their potential influence on promoting health equity. To address this gap, this paper assesses equity in the distribution of health care inputs across public primary health facilities at the district level in Tanzania. Methods: This is a quantitative assessment of equity in the distribution of health care inputs (staff, drugs, medical supplies and equipment) from district to facility level. The study was carried out in three districts (Kinondoni, Singida Rural and Manyoni district) in Tanzania. These districts were selected because they were implementing primary care reforms. We administered 729 exit surveys with patients seeking out-patient care; and health facility surveys at 69 facilities in early 2014. A total of seventeen indices of input availability were constructed with the collected data. The distribution of inputs was considered in relation to (i) the wealth of patients accessing the facilities, which was taken as a proxy for the wealth of the population in the catchment area; and (ii) facility distance from the district headquarters. We assessed equity in the distribution of inputs through the use of equity ratios, concentration indices and curves. Results: We found a significant pro-rich distribution of clinical staff and nurses per 1000 population. Facilities with the poorest patients (most remote facilities) have fewer staff per 1000 population than those with the least poor patients (least remote facilities): 0.6 staff per 1000 among the poorest, compared to 0.9 among the least poor; 0.7 staff per 1000 among the most remote facilities compared to 0.9 among the least remote. The negative concentration index for support staff suggests a pro-poor distribution of this cadre but the 45 degree dominated the concentration curve. The distribution of vaccines, antibiotics, anti-diarrhoeal, anti-malarials and medical supplies was approximately proportional (non dominance), whereas the distribution of oxytocics, anti-retroviral therapy ({ART}) and anti-hypertensive drugs was pro-rich, with the 45 degree line dominating the concentration curve for {ART}. Conclusion: This study has shown there are inequities in the distribution of health care inputs across public primary care facilities. This highlights the need to ensure a better coordinated and equitable distribution of inputs through regular monitoring of the availability of health care inputs and strengthening of reporting systems. © 2017 The Author(s).},

Methods Using the Surgeons {OverSeas} Assessment of Surgical Need ({SOSAS}) survey, we enumerated 2176 children in 2315 households throughout Uganda. At the district level, we determined the spatial autocorrelation of surgical need with geographic access to surgical centers variable. Findings The highest average distance to a surgical center was found in the northern region at 14.97 km (95\% {CI}: 11.29 km–16.89 km). Younger children less than five years old had a higher prevalence of unmet surgical need in all four regions than their older counterparts. The spatial regression model showed that distance to surgical center and care availability were the main spatial predictors of unmet surgical need. Interpretation We found differences in unmet surgical need by region and age group of the children, which could serve as priority areas for focused interventions to alleviate the burden.

This paper describes the process of capacity building Community Health Volunteers ({CHVs}) to deliver integrated preventive and curative package of care of services to manage common childhood illness in hard-to-reach communities in Bondo Subcounty, Kenya. Methods: A pre-test/post-test single-group design was used to assess changes in knowledge and skills related to integrated community case management ({iCCM}) among 58 Community Health Volunteers who received a six-day {iCCM} clinical training and an additional 3-week clinical coaching at health facilities. Thereafter, community health extension workers and health managers provided supportive supervision over a six-month period. Skills were assessed before the six-day training, during coaching, and after six months of {iCCM} implementation. Results: {CHVs} knowledge assessment scores improved from 54.5\% to 72.9\% after the six-day training (p {\textless} 0.001). All 58 {CHVs} could assess and classify fever and diarrhoea correctly after 3–6 weeks of facility-based clinical coaching; 97\% could correctly identify malnutrition and 80\%, suspected pneumonia. The majority correctly performed four of the six steps in malaria rapid diagnostic testing. However, only 58\% could draw blood correctly and 67\% dispose of waste correctly after the testing. The proportion of {CHV} exhibiting appropriate skills to examine for signs of illness improved from 4\% at baseline to 74\% after 6 months of {iCCM} implementation, p {\textless} 0.05. The proportion of caregivers in intervention community units who first sought treatment from a {CHV} increased from 2 to 31 percent (p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: Training and clinical coaching built {CHV}’s skills to manage common childhood illnesses. The {CHVs} demonstrated ability to follow the Kenya {iCCM} algorithm for decision-making on whether to treat or refer a sick child. The communities’ confidence in {CHVs}’ ability to deliver integrated case management resulted in modification of care-seeking behaviour. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective To estimate both crude and effective curative health services coverage provided by rural health facilities to under 5-year-old (U5YO) children in Burkina Faso. Methods We surveyed 1298 child health providers and 1681 clinical cases across 494 primary-level health facilities, as well as 12 497 U5YO children across 7347households in the facilities' catchment areas. Facilities were scored based on a set of indicators along three quality-of-care dimensions: Management of common childhood diseases, management of severe childhood diseases and general service readiness. Linking service quality to service utilisation, we estimated both crude and effective coverage of U5YO children by these selected curative services. Results Measured performance quality among facilities was generally low with only 12.7\% of facilities surveyed reaching our definition of high and 57.1\% our definition of intermediate quality of care. The crude coverage was 69.5\% while the effective coverages indicated that 5.3\% and 44.6\% of children reporting an illness episode received services of only high or high and intermediate quality, respectively. Conclusion Our study showed that the quality of U5YO child health services provided by primary-level health facilities in Burkina Faso was low, resulting in relatively ineffective population coverage. Poor adherence to clinical treatment guidelines combined with the lack of equipment and qualified clinical staff that performed U5YO consultations seemed to be contributors to the gap between crude and effective coverage. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.},

User fees are, however, important sources of income for health facilities and their removal has implications for the way in which health facilities are governed. Objective To explore how implementation of Kenya's financing policy has affected the way in which the rules governing health facilities are made, changed, monitored and enforced. Methods Qualitative research was carried out using semistructured interviews with 39 key stakeholders from six counties in Kenya: 10 national level policy makers, 10 county level policy makers and 19 implementers at health facilities. Participants were purposively selected using maximum variation sampling. Data analysis was informed by the institutional analysis framework, in which governance is defined by the rules that distribute roles among key players and shape their actions, decisions and interactions. results Lack of clarity about the new policy (eg, it was unclear which services were free, leading to instances of service user exploitation), weak enforcement mechanisms (eg, delayed reimbursement to health facilities, which led to continued levying of service charges) and misaligned incentives (eg, the policy led to increased uptake of services thereby increasing the workload for health workers and health facilities losing control of their ability to generate and manage their own resources) led to weak policy implementation, further complicated by the concurrent devolution of the health system. conclusion The findings show the consequences of discrepancies between formal institutions and informal arrangements. In introducing new policies, policy makers should ensure that corresponding institutional (re) arrangements, enforcement mechanisms and incentives are aligned with the objectives of the implementers. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

	abstract = {Background: The Zika virus epidemic in Latin America has elicited official recommendations for women to delay or avoid pregnancy in affected countries, which has increased demand for family planning services. It is likely, however, that health facilities in areas where the population is most vulnerable to the disease lack the capacity to respond to the increased demand for family planning services. Our objectives are to perform facilities assessment and understand client perceptions in areas affected by Zika virus, and to track changes in these parameters over time. Methods/design: We will collaborate with local health authorities to map facilities that have the capacity to provide services in contraception and safe abortion, including induced abortion to the full extent of the law and post-abortion care for treatment of complications from unsafe abortion and post-abortion contraception. We then will carry out a survey of facilities to assess the availability of services and their readiness to provide contraception and safe abortion care. All facilities will be assessed for baseline readiness and availability of services, and a random subsample of surveyed facilities will be reassessed in second and third rounds of surveys. Focus group interviews with clients will be conducted as part of the facilities surveys in order to gain an understanding of the community's knowledge, needs and perceived barriers to healthcare in the context of the Zika virus epidemic. Discussion: The findings of this study will aid the response to Zika virus ranging from the identification of healthcare facilities that can be potentially strengthened, to the formulation of interventions to reduce barriers and improve readiness of facilities to provide contraception and safe abortion services. Lessons learned from this study will help to build and strengthen health systems that are more prepared to consistently providing reproductive healthcare services in the context of health emergencies. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction Despite recent gains, Kenya did not achieve its Millennium Development Goal ({MDG}) target for reducing under-five mortality. To accelerate progress to 2030, we must understand what impacted mortality throughout the {MDG} period. Methods Trends in the under-five mortality rate (U5MR) were analysed using data from nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (1989-2014). Comprehensive, mixed-methods analyses of health policies and systems, workforce and health financing were conducted using relevant surveys, government documents and key informant interviews with country experts. A hierarchical multivariable linear regression analysis was undertaken to better understand the proximal determinants of change in U5MR over the {MDG} period. Results U5MR declined by 50\% from 1993 to 2014. However, mortality increased between 1990 and 2000, following the introduction of facility user fees and declining coverage of essential interventions. The {MDGs}, together with Kenya's political changes in 2003, ushered in a new era of policymaking with a strong focus on children under 5 years of age. External aid for child health quadrupled from 40 million in 2002 to 180 million in 2012, contributing to the dramatic improvement in U5MR throughout the latter half of the {MDG} period. Our multivariable analysis explained 44\% of the decline in U5MR from 2003 to 2014, highlighting maternal literacy, household wealth, sexual and reproductive health and maternal and infant nutrition as important contributing factors. Children living in Nairobi had higher odds of child mortality relative to children living in other regions of Kenya. Conclusions To attain the Sustainable Development Goal targets for child health, Kenya must uphold its current momentum. For equitable access to health services, user fees must not be reintroduced in public facilities. Support for maternal nutrition and reproductive health should be prioritised, and Kenya should acknowledge its changing demographics in order to effectively manage the escalating burden of poor health among the urban poor. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

	abstract = {Universal malaria diagnostic testing of all fever cases is the first step in correct malaria case management. However, monitoring adherence to universal testing is complicated by unreliable recording and reporting of the true number of fever cases. We searched the literature to obtain gold-standard estimates for the proportion of patients attending outpatient clinics in sub-Saharan Africa with malarial and non-malarial febrile illness. To correct for differences in malaria transmission, wecalculated the proportion of patients with fever after excluding confirmed malaria cases. Next, we analyzed routine data from Guinea and Senegal to calculate the proportion of outpatients tested after exclusion of confirmed malaria cases from the numerator and denominator. From 12 health facility surveys in sub-Saharan Africa with gold-standard fever screening, the median proportion of febrile illness among outpatients after exclusion of confirmed malaria fevers was 57\% (range: 46-80\%). Analysis of routine data after exclusion of confirmed malaria cases demonstrated much lower testing proportions of 23\% (Guinea) and 13\% (Senegal). There was substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity in this testing proportion, and testing in Senegal was correlated with malaria season. Given the evidence from gold-standard surveys that at least 50\% of non-malaria consultations in sub-Saharan Africa are for febrile illness, it appears that a substantial proportion of patients with fever are not tested for malaria in health facilities when considering routine data. Tracking the proportion of patients tested for malaria after exclusion of the confirmed malaria cases could allow programs to make inferences about malaria testing practices using routine data. © Copyright 2018 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.},

	abstract = {Background: To successfully develop and implement school-based sexual health interventions for adolescent girls, such as screening for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis, it is important to understand parents' and teachers' attitudes towards sexual health education and acceptability of sexually transmitted infection ({STI}) screening interventions. Methods: In this qualitative study, we approached parents and teachers from three high schools to participate in in-depth interviews ({IDIs}) and focus-group discussions ({FGDs}). Parents and teachers were asked about their general knowledge of {STIs} and sexual health education. In addition, they were asked whether they would support utilizing outreach to schools to facilitate provision of sexual health education and screening for {STIs} in adolescent girls. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. An initial coding matrix was developed and refined throughout the coding process. Transcripts were coded by two researchers and analyzed using the content analysis approach. Results: We conducted 10 {IDIs} (5 parents and 5 teachers) and 4 {FGDs} (2 with parents, 2 with teachers, total of 26 participants). Most parents reported few or no discussions regarding {STIs} with their adolescent girls. Parents were more comfortable discussing consequences of sexual activity including loss of virginity and the potential for pregnancy. Parents tended to place responsibility for sexual health education with teachers. The teachers, in turn, provided basic sexual and reproductive health education including puberty, abstinence, and overview of {STIs}. Both parents and teachers found the idea of screening for {STIs} in adolescent girls to be acceptable, and were comfortable with research staff contacting girls through informational meetings at schools. Parents felt that adolescents' {STI} screening results should be shared with their parents. Conclusion: In this African setting, parents and teachers provide limited sexual health education, with a focus on negative consequences including loss of virginity, pregnancy, and risk for {STIs}. Nonetheless, both parents and teachers were supportive of {STI} screening for adolescent girls, beginning with school-based informational meetings for the girls. Research and programs that aim to provide {STI} screening in this setting must offer treatment and address the issue of whether results will be disclosed to parents. © 2017 The Author(s).},

Health worker shortages in {HIV} care provision are highest in areas that are worst hit by the {HIV} epidemic. Kenya is listed among countries that experience health worker shortages ({\textless}2.5 health workers per 1000 population) and have a high {HIV} burden ({HIV} prevalence 5.6 with 15.2\% in Nyanza province). We set out to determine the optimum number of clinicians required to provide quality consultancy {HIV} care services at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital, {JOOTRH}, {HIV} Clinic, the premier {HIV} clinic in Nyanza province with a cumulative client enrolment of {PLHIV} of over 20,000 persons. Case presentation: The World Health's Organization's Workload Indicators of Staffing Needs ({WISN}) was used to compute the staffing needs and sufficiency of staffing needs at the {JOOTRH} {HIV} clinic in Kisumu, Kenya, between January and December 2011. All people living with {HIV} ({PLHIV}) who received {HIV} care services at the {HIV} clinic at {JOOTRH} and all the clinicians attending to them were included in this analysis. The actual staffing was divided by the optimal staff requirement to give ratios of staffing excesses or shortages. A ratio of 1.0 indicated optimal staffing, less than 1.0 indicated suboptimal staffing, and more than 1 indicated supra optimal staffing. The {HIV} clinic is served by 56 staff of various cadres. Clinicians (doctors and clinical officers) comprise approximately one fifth of this population (n = 12). All clinicians (excluding the clinic manager, who is engaged in administrative duties and supervisory roles that consumes approximately one third of his time) provide full-time consultancy services. To operate at maximum efficiency, the clinic therefore requires 19 clinicians. The clinic therefore operates with only 60\% of its staffing requirements. Conclusions: Our assessment revealed a severe shortage of clinicians providing consultation services at the {HIV} clinic. Human resources managers should oversee the rational planning, training, retention, and management of human resources for health using the {WISN} which is an objective and reliable means of estimating staffing needs. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction Despite an estimated one-third of the global burden of disease being surgical, only limited estimates of accessibility to surgical treatment in sub-Saharan Africa exist and these remain spatially undefined. Geographical metrics of access to major hospitals were estimated based on travel time. Estimates were then used to assess need for surgery at country level. Methods Major district and regional hospitals were assumed to have capability to perform bellwether procedures. Geographical locations of hospitals in relation to the population in the 47 sub-Saharan countries were combined with spatial ancillary data on roads, elevation, land use or land cover to estimate travel-time metrics of 30 min, 1 hour and 2 hours. Hospital catchment was defined as population residing in areas less than 2 hours of travel time to the next major hospital. Travel-time metrics were combined with fine-scale population maps to define burden of surgery at hospital catchment level. results Overall, the majority of the population (92.5\%) in sub-Saharan Africa reside in areas within 2 hours of a major hospital catchment defined based on spatially defined travel times. The burden of surgery in all-age population was 257.8 million to 294.7 million people and was highest in high-population density countries and lowest in sparsely populated or smaller countries. The estimated burden in children {\textless}15 years was 115.3 million to 131.8 million and had similar spatial distribution to the all-age pattern. Conclusion The study provides an assessment of accessibility and burden of surgical disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet given the optimistic assumption of adequare surgical capability of major hospitals, the true burden of surgical disease is expected to be much greater. In-depth health facility assessments are needed to define infrastructure, personnel and medicine supply for delivering timely and safe affordable surgery to further inform the analysis. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

In 2013, Kenya devolved health and other services from central government to 47 new sub-national governments (known as counties). This transition seeks to strengthen democracy and accountability, increase community participation, improve efficiency and reduce inequities. With changing responsibilities and power following devolution reforms, comes the need for priority-setting at the new county level. Priority-setting arises as a consequence of the needs and demand for healthcare resources exceeding the resources available, resulting in the need for some means of choosing between competing demands. We sought to explore the impact of devolution on priority-setting for health equity and community health services. We conducted key informant and in-depth interviews with health policymakers, health providers and politicians from 10 counties (n = 269 individuals) and 14 focus group discussions with community members based in 2 counties (n = 146 individuals). Qualitative data were analysed using the framework approach. We found Kenya's devolution reforms were driven by the need to demonstrate responsiveness to county contexts, with positive ramifications for health equity in previously neglected counties. The rapidity of the process, however, combined with limited technical capacity and guidance has meant that decision-making and prioritization have been captured and distorted for political and power interests. Less visible community health services that focus on health promotion, disease prevention and referral have been neglected within the prioritization process in favour of more tangible curative health services. The rapid transition in power carries a degree of risk of not meeting stated objectives. As Kenya moves forward, decision-makers need to address the community health gap and lay down institutional structures, processes and norms which promote health equity for all Kenyans. © The Author(s) 2018.

	abstract = {Background. Despite significant progress in diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis over the past 2 decades, millions of patients with tuberculosis go unreported every year. The patient-pathway analysis ({PPA}) is designed to assess the alignment between tuberculosis care-seeking patterns and the availability of tuberculosis services. The {PPA} can help programs understand where they might find the missing patients with tuberculosis. Methods. This analysis aggregates and compares the {PPAs} from case studies in Kenya, Ethiopia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Pakistan. Results. Across the 5 countries, 24\% of patients with tuberculosis initiated care seeking in a facility with tuberculosis diagnostic capacity. Forty-two percent of patients sought care at level 0 facilities, where there was generally no tuberculosis diagnostic capacity; another 42\% of patients sought care at level 1 facilities, of which 39\% had diagnostic capacity. Sixty-six percent of patients initially sought care in private facilities, which had considerably less tuberculosis diagnostic capacity than public facilities; only 7\% of notified cases were from the private sector. The {GeneXpert} system was available in 14\%-41\% of level 2 facilities in the 3 countries for which there were data. Tuberculosis treatment capacity tracked closely with the availability of diagnostic capacity. There were substantial subnational differences in care-seeking patterns and service availability. Discussion. The {PPA} can be a valuable planning and programming tool to ensure that diagnostic and treatment services are available to patients where they seek care. Patient-centered care will require closing the diagnostic gap and engaging the private sector. Extensive subnational differences in patient pathways to care call for differentiated approaches to patient-centered care.},

	abstract = {Background: Recent scientific achievements and technological advances have brought forward a massive display of new or updated medical devices, enabled with highly-developed embedded-control functions and interactivity. From the final decade of the twentieth century, medical beds have particularly been affected by this surge, taking on new forms and functions, while accommodating to established properties that have become well-known for these devices. The past fifteen years have also brought forward changes to conceptual frameworks, concerning the product design and manufacturing processes (standards), as well as the patient (perspectives on patient-care environments and accessibility). This work presents a state-of-art survey on electric medical beds, representing what is defined as the time of “smart beds”, as part of an increasingly comprehensive patient-care environment. Methods: A survey and assessment of market trends, research efforts and standards related to smart medical beds was performed, covering a wide range of public records of intellectual property, models and related healthcare solutions, as well as relevant research efforts in the field between 2000 and 2016. Contextual topics, necessary for the understanding of this subject, on novel technologies, disability and the reach of healthcare systems, were also researched and interpreted. Results: The new generation of electric medical beds is defined, with the final stage of the proposed timeline for these devices being covered. Functional, aesthetic and interactive features are presented, and the current global market for medical beds and related standards are also assessed. Finally, discussions concerning rising challenges and opportunities for these systems are explored, with the potential for adding further monitoring and assistive implementations into medical devices and environments being highlighted. Conclusions: Smart medical beds are integrated solutions for patient care, assistance and monitoring, based on a comprehensive, multidisciplinary design approach. Research in this field is critical in a context of global ageing, and powered by a surge in opportunities for accessibility solutions. Smart beds, seamlessly integrated into the healthcare system, have a unique opportunity in enabling more efficient efforts for caregivers, and more responsive environments for patients. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {We analysed the performance of Ethiopia in achieving the health-related millennium development goals ({MDGs}) with the aim of acquiring lessons for the sustainable development goals ({SDGs}). Ethiopia achieved most of the health {MDGs}: a 67\% reduction in under-five mortality, a 71\% decline in maternal mortality ratio, a 90\% decline in new {HIV} infections, a decrease in malaria-related deaths by 73\% and a more than 50\% decline in mortality due to tuberculosis. We argue that these achievements are due to implementation of a mix of comprehensive strategies within the health system and across other sectors of the government. Scaling up of interventions by disease control programmes (including the health extension programme) and strengthening of the health system have played important roles towards the achievements. These health gains could not have been realised without progress in the other {MDGs}: poverty reduction, education, access to safe drinking-water and peace and stability of the country. However, the gains were not equitable, with differences between urban and rural areas, among regions and socioeconomic strata. Ethiopia’s remarkable success in meeting most of the targets of the health-related {MDGs} could be explained by its comprehensive and multisectoral approach for health development. The inequity gap remains a challenge that achieving the health-related {SDGs} requires the country to implement strategies, which specifically target more marginal populations and geographic areas. This also needs peace and stability, without which it is almost impossible to improve health. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

	abstract = {Background: At the end of the eleven-year conflict in Sierra Leone, a wide range of policies were implemented to address both demand- and supply-side constraints within the healthcare system, which had collapsed during the conflict. This study examines the extent to which households' exposure to financial risks associated with seeking healthcare evolved in post-conflict Sierra Leone. Method: This study uses the 2003 and 2011 cross-sections of the Sierra Leone Integrated Household Survey to examine changes in catastrophic health expenditure between 2003 and 2011. An Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition approach is used to quantify the extent to which changes in catastrophic health expenditure are attributable to changes in the distribution of determinants (distributional effect) and to changes in the impact of these determinants on the probability of incurring catastrophic health expenditure (coefficient effect). Results: The incidence of catastrophic health expenditure decreased significantly by 18\% from approximately 50\% in 2003 t0 32\% in 2011. The decomposition analysis shows that this decrease represents net effects attributable to the distributional and coefficient effects of three determinants of catastrophic health expenditure - ill-health, the region in which households reside and the type of health facility used. A decrease in the incidence of ill-health and changes in the regional location of households contributed to a decrease in catastrophic health expenditure. The distributional effect of health facility types observed as an increase in the use of public health facilities, and a decrease in the use of services in facilities owned by non-governmental organizations ({NGOs}) also contributed to a decrease in the incidence of catastrophic health expenditure. However, the coefficient effect of public health facilities and {NGO}-owned facilities suggests that substantial exposure to financial risk remained for households utilizing both types of health facilities in 2011. Conclusion: The findings support the need to continue expanding current demand-side policies in Sierra Leone to reduce the financial risk of exposure to ill health. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objectives. This study aimed to assess the health workforce's service capacities within a health Service Delivery Network ({SDN}) of an urban poor and a rural poor setting. Methods. This is a concurrent mixed-methods study implemented in Navotas and Masbate, an urban poor and a rural poor area, respectively. Health needs of the residents were assessed through records review, qualitative methods and a household survey. Health facilities in the identified {SDN} were assessed using the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) tool. Training data of Human Resource for Health ({HRH}) were also obtained. Results. {SDN} in the two areas are different in terms of formality where memoranda of agreement were prepared between Masbate facilities but not in Navotas. Health worker to population ratios were 12.1 per 10,000 in Navotas and 2.7 in Masbate, respectively. The primary care facilities in the two sites met the recommended level of trainings for health workers in obstetric care, immunization, childhood nutrition and tuberculosis. There was a lack of post-graduate training in non-communicable diseases in all facilities. Poverty and geography were significant factors affecting health service delivery. Conclusion. In terms of human resources, both sites have limited number of health workers and the ratios fall far below {WHO} guideline. Recommendations include: Primary health care staff complement should be increased in the two {SDNs}. {HHRDB} should conduct a study to settle the issue of continuing medical education requirements that are not congruent with {WHO} recommendations. The {SDNs} should include the access of medicines and commodities by poor patients in private facilities during times of stock outs. Also, during stock outs or unavailability of government health personnel, transportation should be made available via the {SDN} to transport poor patients to private or nongovernment facilities with the needed personnel. The {DOH} and {HHRDB} should investigate innovative strategies for telehealth services that do not require continuous electricity, nor telephone or cellphone signal. © 2018 University of the Philippines Manila.

	abstract = {The lack of human resources is a key challenge in scaling up of {HIV} services in Africa’s health care system. Integrating {HIV} services could potentially increase their effectiveness and optimize the use of limited resources and clinical staff time. We examined the impact of integration of provider initiated {HIV} counselling and testing ({PITC}) and family planning ({FP} counselling and {FP} provision) services on duration of consultation to assess the impact of {PITC} and {FP} integration on staff workload. This study was conducted in 24 health facilities in Kenya under the Integra Initiative, a non-randomized, pre/post intervention trial to evaluate the impact of integrated {HIV} and sexual and reproductive health services on health and service outcomes. We compared the time spent providing {PITC}-only services, {FP}-only services and integrated {PITC}/{FP} services. We used log-linear regression to assess the impact of plausible determinants on the duration of clients’ consultation times. Median consultation duration times were highest for {PITC}-only services (30 min), followed by integrated services (10 min) and {FP}-only services (8 min). Times for {PITC}-only and {FP}-only services were 69.7\% higher (95\% Confidence Intervals ({CIs}) 35.8–112.0) and 43.9\% lower (95\% {CIs} 55.4 to 29.6) than times spent on these services when delivered as an integrated service, respectively. The reduction in consultation times with integration suggests a potential reduction in workload. The higher consultation time for {PITC}-only could be because more pre- and post-counselling is provided at these stand-alone services. In integrated {PITC}/{FP} services, the duration of the visit fell below that required by {HIV} testing guidelines, and service mix between counselling and testing substantially changed. Integration of {HIV} with {FP} services may compromise the quality of services delivered and care must be taken to clearly specify and monitor appropriate consultation duration times and procedures during the process of integrating {HIV} and {FP} services. © The Author 2017.},

We sought to understand how geographic factors related to unmet surgical need ({USN}) in Uganda. Methods: We performed a geographic information system analysis of a nationwide survey on surgical conditions performed in 105 enumeration areas ({EAs}) representing the national population. At the district level, we determined the spatial autocorrelation of the following study variables: prevalence of {USN}, hub distance (distance from {EA} to the nearest surgical center), area of coverage (geographic catchment area of each center), tertiary facility transport time (average respondent-reported travel time), and care availability (rate of hospital beds by population and by district). We then used local indicators of spatial association ({LISA}) and spatial regression to identify any significant clustering of these study variables among the districts. Results: The survey enumerated 4248 individuals. The prevalence of {USN} varied from 2.0–45 \%. The {USN} prevalence was highest in the Northern and Western Regions. Moran’s I bivariate analysis indicated a positive correlation between {USN} and hub distance (p = 0.03), area of coverage (p = 0.02), and facility transport time (p = 0.03). These associations were consistent nationally. The {LISA} analysis showed a high degree of clustering among sets of districts in the Northern Sub-Region. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a statistically significant association between {USN} and the geographic variables examined.

	abstract = {Weakness of primary health-care ({PHC}) systems has represented a challenge to the achievement of the targets of disease control programmes ({DCPs}) despite the availability of substantial development assistance for health, in resource-poor settings. Since 2005, Ethiopia has embraced a diagonal investment approach to strengthen its {PHC} systems and concurrently scale up {DCPs}. This approach has led to a substantial improvement in {PHC}-system capacity that has contributed to increased coverage of {DCPs} and improved health status, although gaps in equity and quality in health services remain to be addressed. Since 2013, Ethiopia has had a decline in development assistance for health. Nevertheless, the Ethiopian Government has been able to compensate for this decline by increasing domestic resources. We argue that the diagonal investment approach can effectively strengthen {PHC} systems, achieve {DCP} targets, and sustain the gains. These goals can be achieved if a visionary and committed leadership coordinates its development partners and mobilises the local community, to ensure financial support to health services and improve population health. The lessons learnt from Ethiopia's efforts to improve its health services indicate that global-health initiatives should have a proactive and balanced investment approach to concurrently strengthen {PHC} systems, achieve programme targets, and sustain the gains, in resource-poor settings. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: The number of maternal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa continues to be overwhelmingly high. In West Africa, Sierra Leone leads the list, with the highest maternal mortality ratio. In 2010, financial barriers were removed as an incentive for more women to use available antenatal, delivery and postnatal services. Few published studies have examined the quality of free antenatal services and access to emergency obstetric care in Sierra Leone. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2014 in all 97 peripheral health facilities and three hospitals in Bombali District, Northern Region. One hundred antenatal care providers were interviewed, 276 observations were made and 486 pregnant women were interviewed. We assessed the adequacy of antenatal and delivery services provided using national standards. The distance was calculated between each facility providing delivery services and the nearest comprehensive emergency obstetric care ({CEOC}) facility, and the proportion of facilities in a chiefdom within 15 km of each {CEOC} facility was also calculated. A thematic map was developed to show inequities. Results: The quality of services was poor. Based on national standards, only 27\% of women were examined, 2\% were screened on their first antenatal visit and 47\% received interventions as recommended. Although 94\% of facilities provided delivery services, a minority had delivery rooms (40\%), delivery kits (42\%) or portable water (46\%). Skilled attendants supervised 35\% of deliveries, and in only 35\% of these were processes adequately documented. None of the five basic emergency obstetric care facilities were fully compliant with national standards, and the central and northernmost parts of the district had the least access to comprehensive emergency obstetric care. Conclusion: The health sector needs to monitor the quality of antenatal interventions in addition to measuring coverage. The quality of delivery services is compromised by poor infrastructure, inadequate skilled staff, stock-outs of consumables, non-functional basic emergency obstetric care facilities, and geographic inequities in access to {CEOC} facilities. These findings suggest that the health sector needs to urgently investigate continuing inequities adversely influencing the uptake of these services, and explore more sustainable funding mechanisms. Without this, the country is unlikely to achieve its goal of reducing maternal deaths. © 2017 The Author(s).},

This study reviews the performance of the {ART} program in Ethiopia during the past decade, and identifies successes and weaknesses toward ending {AIDS} in the country. Methods A review and synthesis of data was conducted using multiple data sources: reports from all health facilities in Ethiopia to the Federal Ministry of Health, {HIV}/{AIDS} estimates and projections, and retrospective cohort and cross-sectional studies conducted between 2005/6 and 2014/15. Findings The {ART} program has been successful over several critical areas: (1) {ART} coverage improved from 4\% to 54\%; (2) the median {CD}4 count/mm3 at the time of {ART} initiation increased from 125 in 2005/6 to 231 in 2012/13; (3) retention in care after 12 months on {ART} has increased from 82\% to 92\%. In spite of these successes, important challenges also remain: (1) {ART} coverage is not equitable: among regions (5.6\%-93\%), between children (25\%) and adults (60\%), and between female (54\%) and male patients (69\%); (2) retention in care is variable among regions (83\%-94\%); and, (3) the shift to second-line {ART} is slow and low (0·58\%). Interpretation The findings suggest that the {ART} program should sustain the successes and reflect on the shortcomings toward the goal of ending {AIDS}. It is important to capitalize on and calibrate the interventions and approaches utilized to scale up {ART} in the past.

	abstract = {Background. Tuberculosis ({TB}) is the fourth leading cause of death in Indonesia. In 2015, the World Health Organization estimated that nearly two-thirds of the {TB} patients in Indonesia had not been notified, and the status of their care remained unknown. As such, Indonesia is home to nearly 20\% of the world's "missing" {TB} patients. Understanding where patients go for care may enable strategic planning of services to better reach them. Methods. A patient pathway analysis ({PPA}) was conducted to assess the alignment between patient care seeking and the availability of {TB} diagnostic and treatment services at the national and subnational level in Indonesia. Results. The {PPA} results revealed that only 20\% of patients encountered diagnostic capacity at the location where they first sought care. Most initial care seeking occurred in the private sector and case notification lagged behind diagnostic confirmation in the public sector. Conclusions. The {PPA} results emphasize the role that the private sector plays in {TB} patient care seeking and suggested a need for differentiated approaches, by province, to respond to variances in care-seeking patterns and the capacities of public and private providers.},

Design Nationally representative, repeated crosssectional surveys of women and health facilities. Setting Tanzania. Participants Women of reproductive age and health facility staff. Main outcome measures Population-based caesarean rate, absolute annual number of caesareans, percentage of facilities reporting to perform caesareans and three readiness indicators for safe caesarean care: Availability of consistent electricity, 24 hour schedule for caesarean and anaesthesia providers, and availability of all general anaesthesia equipment. Results The caesarean rate in Tanzania increased threefold from 2\% in 1996 to 6\% in 2015-16, while the total number of births increased by 60\%. As a result, the absolute number of caesareans increased almost fivefold to 120 000 caesareans per year. The main mechanism sustaining the increase in caesareans was the doubling of median caesarean volume among public hospitals, from 17 caesareans per month in 2006 to 35 in 2014-15. The number of facilities performing caesareans increased only modestly over the same period. Less than half (43\%) of caesareans in Tanzania in 2014-15 were performed in facilities meeting the three readiness indicators. Consistent electricity was widely available, and 24 hour schedules for caesarean and (less systematically) anaesthesia providers were observed in most facilities; however, the availability of all general anaesthesia equipment was the least commonly reported indicator, present in only 44\% of all facilities (34\% of public hospitals). Conclusions Given the rising trend in numbers of caesareans, urgent improvements in the availability of general anaesthesia equipment and trained anaesthesia staff should be made to ensure the safety of caesareans. Initial efforts should focus on improving anaesthesia provision in public and faith-based organisation hospitals, which together perform more than 90\% of all caesareans in Tanzania. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.},

	abstract = {Background: The critical shortage of human resources in health is a critical public health problem affecting most low- and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to the shortage of health professionals, attracting and retaining them in rural areas is a challenge. The objective of the study was to understand the factors that influence the attraction and retention of health professionals working in rural areas in Niger. Methods: A mixed-method study was conducted in Tillabery region, Niger. A conceptual framework was used that included five dimensions. Three data collection methods were employed: in-depth interviews, documentary analysis, and concept mapping. In-depth interviews were conducted with three main actor groups: policy-makers and Ministry of Health officials (n = 15), health professionals (n = 102), and local health managers (n = 46). Concept mapping was conducted with midwifery students (n = 29). Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were performed to analyse the data from the concept mapping method. A content analysis was conducted for the qualitative data. Results: The results of the study showed that the local environment, which includes living conditions (no electricity, lack of availability of schools), social factors (isolation, national and local insecurity), working conditions (workload), the lack of financial compensation, and individual factors (marital status, gender), influences the attraction and retention of health professionals to work in rural areas. Human resources policies do not adequately take into account the factors influencing the retention of rural health professionals. Conclusion: Intersectoral policies are needed to improve living conditions and public services in rural areas. The government should also take into account the feminization of the medical profession and the social and cultural norms related to marital status and population mobility when formulating human resources management policies. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Availability and accessibility of sexual and reproductive health services for adolescents are very crucial for prevention and control of sexual and reproductive health problems. These services also play vital roles in the promotion of adolescents' sexual and reproductive health generally. The main purpose of the study was to determine the availability and accessibility (geographical and financial) of sexual and reproductive health services ({SRHS}) among adolescents in Enugu State, Nigeria. Methods: A mixed methods approach was adopted for the study. 192 health facilities were reached to check availability of {SRH} services. Randomly sampled 1447 adolescents (12-22 years) completed the questionnaire correctly. Twenty-seven interviews and 18 group discussions were conducted. Instruments for data collection consisted of a checklist, a questionnaire, a focus group discussion guide and an in-depth interview guide. All instruments were pre-tested. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Chi-square tests. {NVivo} 11 Pro software was used to code and thematically analyze the qualitative data. Results: A total of 1447 adolescents (between 12 and 22 years) completed the questionnaire correctly. Among these adolescents, males constituted 42.9\% while females were 57.1\%. The majority (86.7\%) of the adolescents reported availability of safe motherhood services, and 67.5\% reported availability of services for prevention and management of {STIs} and {HIV} and {AIDS}. The majority reported that these services were geographically accessible but few were financially accessible to adolescents. However, qualitative data revealed that available services were not specifically provided for adolescents but for general use. Age (p = ≤.05), education (p = ≤.05) and income (p = ≤.05) were found to be significantly associated with access to {SRHS}. Conclusion: {SRHS} were generally physically available but not financially accessible to adolescents. Adolescents' clinics were not available and this could affect the access of {SRHS} by adolescents. Education and income were significantly associated with access to {SRHS}. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Hospitals in Sub-Saharan Africa ({SSA}) face major workforce challenges while having to deal with extraordinary high burdens of disease. The effectiveness of human resource management ({HRM}) is therefore of particular interest for these {SSA} hospitals. While, in general, the relationship between {HRM} and hospital performance is extensively investigated, most of the underlying empirical evidence is from western countries and may have limited validity in {SSA}. Evidence on this relationship for {SSA} hospitals is scarce and scattered. We present a systematic review of empirical studies investigating the relationship between {HRM} and performance in {SSA} hospitals. Following the {PRISMA} protocol, searching in seven databases (i.e., Embase, {MEDLINE}, Web of Science, Cochrane, {PubMed}, {CINAHL}, Google Scholar) yielded 2252 hits and a total of 111 included studies that represent 19 out of 48 {SSA} countries. From a {HRM} perspective, most studies researched {HRM} bundles that combined practices from motivation-enhancing, skills-enhancing, and empowerment-enhancing domains. Motivation-enhancing practices were most frequently researched, followed by skills-enhancing practices and empowerment-enhancing practices. Few studies focused on single {HRM} practices (instead of bundles). Training and education were the most researched single practices, followed by task shifting. From a performance perspective, our review reveals that employee outcomes and organizational outcomes are frequently researched, whereas team outcomes and patient outcomes are significantly less researched. Most studies report {HRM} interventions to have positively impacted performance in one way or another. As researchers have studied a wide variety of (bundled) interventions and outcomes, our analysis does not allow to present a structured set of effective one-to-one relationships between specific {HRM} interventions and performance measures. Instead, we find that specific outcome improvements can be accomplished by different {HRM} interventions and conversely that similar {HRM} interventions are reported to affect different outcome measures. In view of the high burden of disease, our review identified remarkable little evidence on the relationship between {HRM} and patient outcomes. Moreover, the presented evidence often fails to provide contextual characteristics which are likely to induce variety in the performance effects of {HRM} interventions. Coordinated research efforts to advance the evidence base are called for. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: A situational analysis of breast cancer ({BC}) early detection services was carried out to investigate whether Trinidad and Tobago (T\&T) has the framework for successful organized national screening. Methods: An online survey was designed to assess the availability, accessibility, quality control and assurance ({QC}\&A), and monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) mechanisms for public and private {BC} early detection. A focus group with local radiologists (n = 3) was held to identify unaddressed challenges and make recommendations for improvement. Results: Major public hospitals offer free detection services with wait times of 1–6 months for an appointment. Private institutions offer mammograms for {TTD}\$240 ({USD}\$37) at minimum with same day service. Both sectors report a lack of trained staff. Using 1.2 mammograms per 10,000 women ≥40 years as sufficient, the public sector’s rate of 0.19 mammograms per 10,000 women ≥40 years for screening and diagnosis is inadequate. Program M\&E mechanisms, {QC}\&A guidelines for machinery use, delays in receipt of pathology reports, and unreliable drug access are further unaddressed challenges. Conclusion: T\&T must first strengthen its human and physical resources, implement M\&E and {QC}\&A measures, strengthen cancer care, and address other impediments to {BC} early detection before investing in nationally organized {BC} screening. © 2017, Springer International Publishing {AG}.},

	abstract = {Background: The postpartum period represents a critical window where many maternal and child deaths occur. We assess the quality of postpartum care ({PPC}) as well as efforts to improve service delivery through additional training and supervision in Health Centers ({HCs}) in Morogoro Region, Tanzania. Methods: Program implementers purposively selected nine program {HCs} for assessment with another nine {HCs} in the region remaining as comparison sites in a non-randomized program evaluation. {PPC} quality was assessed by examining structural inputs; provider and client profiles; processes ({PNC} counselling) and outcomes (patient knowledge) through direct observations of equipment, supplies and infrastructure (n = 18) and {PPC} counselling (n = 45); client exit interviews (n = 41); a provider survey (n = 62); and in-depth provider interviews (n = 10). Results: While physical infrastructure, equipment and supplies were comparable across study sites (with water and electricity limitations), program areas had better availability of drugs and commodities. Overall, provider availability was also similar across study sites, with 63\% of {HCs} following staffing norms, 17\% of Reproductive and Child Health ({RCH}) providers absent and 14\% of those providing {PPC} being unqualified to do so. In the program area, a median of 4 of 10 {RCH} providers received training. Despite training and supervisory inputs to program area {HCs}, provider and client knowledge of {PPC} was low and the content of {PPC} counseling provided limited to 3 of 80 {PPC} messages in over half the consultations observed. Among women attending {PPC}, 29 (71\%) had delivered in a health facility and sought care a median of 13 days after delivery. Barriers to {PPC} care seeking included perceptions that {PPC} was of limited benefit to women and was primarily about child health, geographic distance, gaps in the continuity of care, and harsh facility treatment. Conclusions: Program training and supervision activities had a modest effect on the quality of {PPC}. To achieve broader transformation in {PPC} quality, client perceptions about the value of {PPC} need to be changed; the content of recommended {PPC} messages reviewed along with the location for {PPC} services; gaps in the availability of human resources addressed; and increased provider-client contact encouraged. © 2018 The Author(s).},

The survey consisted of 8 domains; specific items within domains were modified from previously developed survey tools. We distributed the survey by e-mail to a convenience sample of health care providers responsible for providing care to critically ill patients. We assessed clinical sensibility and test-retest reliability. Results Nine of 15 health care providers responded to the survey on 2 separate occasions, separated by 2 to 4 weeks. Clinical sensibility was high (3.9-4.9/5 on assessment tool). Test-retest reliability for questions related to resource availability was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.94; 95\% confidence interval, 0.75-0.99; mean ({SD}) of weighted κ values = 0.67 [0.19]).

	abstract = {Background: Effective coverage requires that those in need can access skilled care supported by adequate resources. There are, however, few studies of effective coverage of facility-based neonatal care in low-income settings, despite the recognition that improving newborn survival is a global priority. Methods: We used a detailed retrospective review of medical records for neonatal admissions to public, private not-for-profit (mission) and private-for-profit (private) sector facilities providing 24×7 inpatient neonatal care in Nairobi City County to estimate the proportion of small and sick newborns receiving nationally recommended care across six process domains. We used our findings to explore the relationship between facility measures of structure and process and estimate effective coverage. Results: Of 33 eligible facilities, 28 (four public, six mission and 18 private), providing an estimated 98.7\% of inpatient neonatal care in the county, agreed to partake. Data from 1184 admission episodes were collected. Overall performance was lowest (weighted mean score 0.35 [95\% confidence interval or {CI}: 0.22-0.48] out of 1) for correct prescription of fluid and feed volumes and best (0.86 [95\% {CI}: 0.80-0.93]) for documentation of demographic characteristics. Doses of gentamicin, when prescribed, were at least 20\% higher than recommended in 11.7\% cases. Larger (often public) facilities tended to have higher process and structural quality scores compared with smaller, predominantly private, facilities. We estimate effective coverage to be 25\% (estimate range: 21-31\%). These newborns received high-quality inpatient care, while almost half (44.5\%) of newborns needed care but did not receive it and a further 30.4\% of newborns received an inadequate service. Conclusions: Failure to receive services and gaps in quality of care both contribute to a shortfall in effective coverage in Nairobi City County. Three-quarters of small and sick newborns do not have access to high-quality facility-based care. Substantial improvements in effective coverage will be required to tackle high neonatal mortality in this urban setting with high levels of poverty. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction Appropriate demand for, and supply of, high quality essential neonatal care is key to improving newborn survival but evaluating such provision has received limited attention in low- and middle-income countries. Moreover, specific local data are needed to support healthcare planning for this vulnerable population. Methods We conducted health facility assessments between July 2015-April 2016, with retrospective review of admission events between 1st July 2014 and 30th June 2015, and used estimates of population-based incidence of neonatal conditions in Nairobi to explore access and evaluate readiness of public, private not-for-profit (mission), and private-for-profit (private) sector facilities providing 24/7 inpatient neonatal care in Nairobi City County. Results In total, 33 (4 public, 6 mission, and 23 private) facilities providing 24/7 inpatient neonatal care in Nairobi City County were identified, 31 were studied in detail. Four public sector facilities, including the only three facilities in which services were free, accounted for 71\% (8,630/12,202) of all neonatal admissions. Large facilities ({\textgreater}900 annual admissions) with adequate infrastructure tended to have high bed occupancy (over 100\% in two facilities), high mortality (15\%), and high patient to nurse ratios (7–15 patients per nurse). Twenty-one smaller, predominantly private, facilities were judged insufficiently resourced to provide adequate care. In many of these, nurses provided newborn and maternity care simultaneously using resources shared across settings, newborn care experience was likely to be limited ({\textless}50 cases per year), there was often no resident clinician, and sick babies were often referred onwards. Results suggest 44\% (9,764/21,966) of Nairobi’s small and sick newborns may not access any of the identified facilities and a further 9\% (2,026/21,966) access facilities judged to be inadequately equipped. Conclusion Over 50\% of Nairobi’s sick newborns may not access a facility with adequate resources to provide essential care. A very high proportion of care accessed is provided by four public and one low cost mission facility; these face major challenges of high patient acuity (high mortality), high patient to nurse ratios, and often overcrowding. Reducing high neonatal mortality in this urban, predominantly poor, population will require effective long-term, multi-sectoral planning and investment. © 2018 Murphy et al.

	abstract = {Background Five billion people lack access to safe, affordable, and timely surgical and anesthesia care. Significant challenges remain in the provision of surgical care in low-resource settings. Uganda is no exception. Methods From September to November 2016, we conducted a mixed-methods countrywide surgical capacity assessment at 17 randomly selected public hospitals in Uganda. Researchers conducted 35 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders to understand factors related to the provision of surgical care. The framework approach was used for thematic and explanatory data analysis. Results The Ugandan public health care sector continues to face significant challenges in the provision of safe, timely, and affordable surgical care. These challenges can be broadly grouped into preparedness and policy, service delivery, and the financial burden of surgical care. Hospital staff reported challenges including: (1) significant delays in accessing surgical care, compounded by a malfunctioning referral system; (2) critical workforce shortages; (3) operative capacity that is limited by inadequate infrastructure and overwhelmed by emergency and obstetric volume; (4) supply chain difficulties pertaining to provision of essential medications, equipment, supplies, and blood; (5) significant, variable, and sometimes catastrophic expenditures for surgical patients and their families; and (6) a lack of surgery-specific policies and priorities. Despite these challenges, innovative strategies are being used in the public to provide surgical care to those most in need. Conclusion Barriers to the provision of surgical care are cross-cutting and involve constraints in infrastructure, service delivery, workforce, and financing. Understanding current strengths and shortfalls of Uganda’s surgical system is a critical first step in developing effective, targeted policy and programming that will build and strengthen its surgical capacity. © 2018 Albutt et al.

	abstract = {The global prevalence and impact of diabetes has increased dramatically, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This region faces unique challenges in combating the disease including lack of funding for noncommunicable diseases, lack of availability of studies and guidelines specific to the population, lack of availability of medications, differences in urban and rural patients, and inequity between public and private sector health care. Because of these challenges, diabetes has a greater impact on morbidity and mortality related to the disease in sub-Saharan Africa than any other region in the world. In order to address these unacceptably poor trends, contextualized strategies for the prevention, identification, management, and financing of diabetes care within this population must be developed. This narrative review provides insights into the policy landscape, epidemiology, pathophysiology, care protocols, medication availability, and health care systems to give readers a comprehensive summary of many factors in these domains as they pertain to diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to providing a review of the current evidence available in these domains, potential solutions to address the major gaps in care will be proposed to reverse the negative trends seen with diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa. © 2017 Pastakia et al.},

	abstract = {Objective To determine if improved geographical accessibility led to increased uptake of maternity care in the south of the United Republic of Tanzania. Methods In a household census in 2007 and another large household survey in 2013, we investigated 22 243 and 13 820 women who had had a recent live birth, respectively. The proportions calculated from the 2013 data were weighted to account for the sampling strategy. We examined the association between the straight-line distances to the nearest primary health facility or hospital and uptake of maternity care. Findings The percentages of live births occurring in primary facilities and hospitals rose from 12\% (2571/22 243) and 29\% (6477/22 243), respectively, in 2007 to weighted values of 39\% and 40\%, respectively, in 2013. Between the two surveys, women living far from hospitals showed a marked gain in their use of primary facilities, but the proportion giving birth in hospitals remained low (20\%). Use of four or more antenatal visits appeared largely unaffected by survey year or the distance to the nearest antenatal clinic. Although the overall percentage of live births delivered by caesarean section increased from 4.1\% (913/22 145) in the first survey to a weighted value of 6.5\% in the second, the corresponding percentages for women living far from hospital were very low in 2007 (2.8\%; 35/1254) and 2013 (3.3\%). Conclusion For women living in our study districts who sought maternity care, access to primary facilities appeared to improve between 2007 and 2013, however access to hospital care and caesarean sections remained low. © 2017, World Health Organization.

	abstract = {Background: It is increasingly apparent that access to healthcare without adequate quality of care is insufficient to improve population health outcomes. We assess whether the most commonly measured attribute of health facilities in low- and middle-income countries ({LMICs})—the structural inputs to care—predicts the clinical quality of care provided to patients. Methods and findings: Service Provision Assessments are nationally representative health facility surveys conducted by the Demographic and Health Survey Program with support from the {US} Agency for International Development. These surveys assess health system capacity in {LMICs}. We drew data from assessments conducted in 8 countries between 2007 and 2015: Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda. The surveys included an audit of facility infrastructure and direct observation of family planning, antenatal care ({ANC}), sick-child care, and (in 2 countries) labor and delivery. To measure structural inputs, we constructed indices that measured World Health Organization-recommended amenities, equipment, and medications in each service. For clinical quality, we used data from direct observations of care to calculate providers’ adherence to evidence-based care guidelines. We assessed the correlation between these metrics and used spline models to test for the presence of a minimum input threshold associated with good clinical quality. Inclusion criteria were met by 32,531 observations of care in 4,354 facilities. Facilities demonstrated moderate levels of infrastructure, ranging from 0.63 of 1 in sick-child care to 0.75 of 1 for family planning on average. Adherence to evidence-based guidelines was low, with an average of 37\% adherence in sick-child care, 46\% in family planning, 60\% in labor and delivery, and 61\% in {ANC}. Correlation between infrastructure and evidence-based care was low (median 0.20, range from −0.03 for family planning in Senegal to 0.40 for {ANC} in Tanzania). Facilities with similar infrastructure scores delivered care of widely varying quality in each service. We did not detect a minimum level of infrastructure that was reliably associated with higher quality of care delivered in any service. These findings rely on cross-sectional data, preventing assessment of relationships between structural inputs and clinical quality over time; measurement error may attenuate the estimated associations. Conclusion: Inputs to care are poorly correlated with provision of evidence-based care in these 4 clinical services. Healthcare workers in well-equipped facilities often provided poor care and vice versa. While it is important to have strong infrastructure, it should not be used as a measure of quality. Insight into health system quality requires measurement of processes and outcomes of care. © 2017 Leslie et al.},

	abstract = {Introduction: {HIV} is a worldwide health problem with continuing high rates of new infections in many parts of the world. This lack of progress in decreasing overall incidence rates has sparked innovative {HIV} testing strategies, including expansion of testing into the emergency department ({ED}) setting. Emergency departments have been shown to be high-yield testing venues in the United States and other developed world settings. The feasibility of expanding public health {HIV} services in the {ED} in limited-resource countries is unclear. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional feasibility assessment of a convenience sample of four hospitals in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. We administered three adapted interview tools from a previously field-tested survey instrument at each facility (total of 10 interviews) to gather an overview of the health facility, their {HIV} counselling and testing services, and their laboratory services. Results: All of the health facilities had access to basic commodities such as water and electricity. Many had severe human resource limitations and provided care to wide population catchment areas. In addition, there was little integration of {HIV} testing into current daily {ED} operations. Hospital staff identified numerous barriers to future {ED} testing efforts. Conclusions: Although control of the {HIV} epidemic requires innovative testing strategies and treatment, specific assessments are warranted on how to incorporate routine {HIV} testing into an acute care facility like the {ED}, which typically has many competing priorities. The use of a prospective structured tool incorporating both barriers and benefits can provide valuable field-tested guidance for increased programme planning for {HIV} testing. © 2018. The Authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Equity of usage of maternal services during conflict is considered key to reducing maternal health risks globally. However, evidence showing how conflict affects maternal care use among different population groups is minimal. This study examined how the Egyptian acute conflict of 2011-2012 affected maternal care use among different socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic groups. Methods: An 'uncontrolled before-and-after' study design was used to perform multi-level modelling regression analysis on 2014 Egypt Demographic and Health Survey data. The pre-conflict sample included 2569 births occurring from January 2009 to January 2011 and the peri-conflict sample included 4641 births from February 2011 to December 2012. Results: Interaction analysis indicated that the effect of conflict on some aspects of maternal care differed by mother's age, residential status, employment, education level and household wealth. In the stratum-specific analysis, increased odds of skilled delivery during conflict was relatively greater among women who were rural (odds ratio [{OR}] 1.02; 95\%{CI} 1.02-1.03), educated to primary level ({OR} 1.04; 95\%{CI} 1.01-1.07), employed ({OR} 1.04; 95\%{CI} 1.01-1.07), less poor ({OR} 1.03; 95\%{CI} 1.02-1.05) or middle-income ({OR} 1.02; 95\%{CI} 1.01-1.04), than pre-conflict. Similarly, increased odds of physician-assisted delivery during conflict was relatively greater for women who were rural ({OR} 1.03; 95\%{CI} 1.02-1.04), educated to primary level ({OR} 1.05; 95\% {CI} 1.01-1.10), employed ({OR} 1.07; 95\%{CI} 1.02-1.11), or from less poor/middle-income ({OR} 1.03; 95\%{CI} 1.01-1.05 each), and richest quintiles ({OR} 1.02; 95\%{CI} 1.00-1.03). Decreased odds of postnatal care during conflict was relatively greater among women aged 25-29 ({OR} 0.92; 95\%{CI} 0.88-0.96) compared to older women. Conclusions: The association between acute conflict and maternal services usage indicated some vertical equity, as equity patterns during conflict differed from recent trends in Egypt. The association between conflict and maternal care usage among potentially marginalised groups was minimal and not notably inequitable. Specific strategies should be included in maternal health policies to mitigate the unpredictable effect of conflict on maternal care equity. Further research is needed to determine how conflict affects out-of-pocket expenditures and quality-of-care among different socioeconomic groups. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background In Malawi, abortion is legal only if performed to save a woman's life; other attempts to procure an abortion are punishable by 7-14 years imprisonment. Most induced abortions in Malawi are performed under unsafe conditions, contributing to Malawi's high maternal mortality ratio. Malawians are currently debating whether to provide additional exceptions under which an abortion may be legally obtained. An estimated 67,300 induced abortions occurred in Malawi in 2009 (equivalent to 23 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44), but changes since 2009, including dramatic increases in contraceptive prevalence, may have impacted abortion rates. Methods We conducted a nationally representative survey of health facilities to estimate the number of cases of post-abortion care, as well as a survey of knowledgeable informants to estimate the probability of needing and obtaining post-abortion care following induced abortion. These data were combined with national population and fertility data to determine current estimates of induced abortion and unintended pregnancy in Malawi using the Abortion Incidence Complications Methodology. Results We estimate that approximately 141,044 (95\%{CI}: 121,161-160,928) induced abortions occurred in Malawi in 2015, translating to a national rate of 38 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-49 (95\%{CI}: 32 to 43); which varied by geographical zone (range: 28-61). We estimate that 53\%of pregnancies in Malawi are unintended, and that 30\%of unintended pregnancies end in abortion. Given the challenges of estimating induced abortion, and the assumptions required for calculation, results should be viewed as approximate estimates, rather than exact measures. Conclusions The estimated abortion rate in 2015 is higher than in 2009 (potentially due to methodological differences), but similar to recent estimates from nearby countries including Tanzania (36), Uganda (39), and regional estimates in Eastern and Southern Africa (34-35). Over half of pregnancies in Malawi are unintended. Our findings should inform ongoing efforts to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality and to improve public health in Malawi. © 2017 Polis et al.

	abstract = {Background: Nigeria is considering adopting Universal Health Coverage ({UHC}) as an official policy target to ensure access to quality health care services for her population without financial hardship. To facilitate discussion on the topic, the President of Nigeria convened a {UHC} summit in March 2014 to discuss Nigeria's options and strategies to achieve {UHC}. A strategy for achieving {UHC} requires analysis of the available infrastructure to deliver the services. We review the geographic and sectoral distribution of health facilities in Nigeria and discuss implications on the {UHC} strategy selected. Methods: Secondary analysis of data from the Federal Ministry of Health's facility register was performed to assess the geographic and sectoral distribution of health facilities in Nigeria. Additionally, an extensive literature review was conducted to understand {UHC} strategies used by various countries and the associated health facility requirements. Results: Primary health facilities make up 88\% of health facilities in Nigeria while secondary and tertiary health facilities make up 12\% and 0.25\%, respectively. There are more government-owned health facilities than privately owned health facilities (67\% vs 33\%). Secondary health facilities are predominantly privately owned. The ratio of public to private health facilities is much higher in the northern part of the country than in the southern part. Conclusions: The distribution of health facilities across Nigeria is nonuniform. As such, a {UHC} strategy must be responsive to the variation in health facility distribution across the country. Additional investments are needed in some parts of the country to improve access to tertiary health facilities and leverage private sector capacity. © 2018 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Observations of discrimination were clustered at facility level in Kenya, and mapping of facility-level discrimination suggested geographic clustering. {HCWs} were more likely to observe discrimination in facilities without regular supportive supervision (adjusted {OR} [{aOR}] 2.33, 95\%{CI} 1.09-4.96).

We used the opportunity of the introduction of {PBF} in Malawi to investigate whether and how {PBF} affected intrinsic motivation, using a mixed-methods research design theoretically grounded in Self-Determination Theory ({SDT}). The quantitative component served to estimate the impact of {PBF} on intrinsic motivation, relying on a controlled pre- and post-test design, with data collected from health workers in 23 intervention and 10 comparison facilities before (March/April 2013; n = 70) and approximately two years after (June/July 2015; n = 71) the start of the intervention. The qualitative component, relying on in-depth interviews with health workers in selected intervention facilities one (April 2014; n = 21) and two (September 2015; n = 20) years after the start of {PBF}, served to understand how {PBF} did or did not bring about change in intrinsic motivation. Specifically, it allowed us to examine how the various motivation-relevant elements and consequences of {PBF} impacted health workers' basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, which {SDT} postulates as central to intrinsic motivation. Our results suggest that {PBF} did not affect health workers’ overall intrinsic motivation levels, with the intervention having had both positive and negative effects on psychological needs satisfaction. To maximize positive {PBF} effects on intrinsic motivation, our results underline the potential value of explicit strategies to mitigate unintended negative impact of unavoidable design, implementation, and contextual challenges, for instance by building autonomy support activities into {PBF} designs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background Improving access and quality of obstetric service has the potential to avert preventable maternal, neonatal and stillborn deaths, yet little is known about the quality of care received. This study sought to assess obstetric service availability, readiness and coverage within and between 17 low- and middle-income countries. Methods We linked health facility data from the Service Provision Assessments and Service Availability and Readiness Assessments, with corresponding household survey data obtained from the Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. Based on performance of obstetric signal functions, we defined four levels of facility emergency obstetric care ({EmOC}) functionality: comprehensive ({CEmOC}), basic ({BEmOC}), {BEmOC}-2, and low/substandard. Facility readiness was evaluated based on the direct observation of 23 essential items; facilities "ready to provide obstetric services" had ≥20 of 23 items available. Across countries, we used medians to characterize service availability and readiness, overall and by urban-rural location; analyses also adjusted for care-seeking patterns to estimate population-level coverage of obstetric services. Results Of the 111 500 health facilities surveyed, 7545 offered obstetric services and were included in the analysis. The median percentages of facilities offering {EmOC} and "ready to provide obstetric services" were 19\% and 10\%, respectively. There were considerable urban-rural differences, with absolute differences of 19\% and 29\% in the availability of facilities offering {EmOC} and "ready to provide obstetric services", respectively. Adjusting for care-seeking patterns, results from the linking approach indicated that among women delivering in a facility, a median of 40\% delivered in facilities offering {EmOC}, and 28\% delivered in facilities "ready to provide obstetric services". Relatively higher coverage of facility deliveries (≥65\%) and coverage of deliveries in facilities "ready to provide obstetric services" (≥30\% of facility deliveries) were only found in three countries. Conclusions The low levels of availability, readiness and coverage of obstetric services documented represent substantial missed opportunities within health systems. Global and national efforts need to prioritize upgrading {EmOC} functionality and improving readiness to deliver obstetric service, particularly in rural areas. The approach of linking health facility and household surveys described here could facilitate the tracking of progress towards quality obstetric care. © 2018 Journal of Global Health.},

	abstract = {Rwanda has shown a dramatic increase in contraceptive use between 2005 (17\%) and 2010 (52\%). However, the overall increase hides striking regional differences. Hence, this study aims to assess the role of regional-level factors to identify persistent barriers to contraceptive use. The research uses the Coale/Lesthaege framework that identifies three preconditions for the use of contraceptives: readiness, willingness and ability. These preconditions are measured at district level using the 2010-Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey and the 2007 Rwanda Service Provision Assessment. A multilevel logistic model is applied to regress the use of modern contraception on these factors. The analysis shows that the overall regional variance is substantial and accounts for more than 50\% of the combined effects of readiness, the need to limit or postpone births, willingness, the norms and attitudes toward contraception use. Ability in terms of access to and quality of family planning services does not add to the explanation. This should, however, be seen as a result of the improvement in access to services provision across the country. The study concludes that the regional differences in contraceptive use are due to the differences in readiness and willingness for family planning. The repositioning of family planning program has raised contraceptive uptake at national level but failed to address the regional variations. Both regional economic development and targeted family planning campaigns are vital to increase use of contraceptives in regions that are still lagging behind. © 2018 Mahidol University, Institute for Population and Social Research.},

	abstract = {Background: A significant determinant of population health outcomes is the quality of care provided for noncommunicable diseases, obstetric, and pediatric care. We present results on clinical practice quality in these areas as measured among nearly 4,000 providers working at more than 1,000 facilities in 6 Eastern European and Central Asian countries. Methods: This study was conducted between March 2011 and April 2013 in Albania, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kirov Province in Russia, and Tajikistan. Using a probability proportional-to-size sampling technique, based on number of hospital beds, we randomly selected within each country 42 hospitals and their associated primary health care clinics. Physicians and midwives within each clinical area of interest were randomly selected from each hospital and clinic and asked how they would care for simulated patients using Clinical Performance and Value ({CPV}) vignettes. Facility administrators were also asked to complete a facility survey to collect structural measures of quality. {CPV} vignettes were scored on a scale of 0\% to 100\% for each provider. We used descriptive statistics and t tests to identify significant differences in {CPV} scores between hospitals and clinics and rural vs. urban facilities, and {ANOVA} to identify significant differences in {CPV} scores across countries. Results: We found that quality of care, as concurrently measured by performance on {CPV} vignettes, was generally poor and widely variable within and between countries. Providers in Kirov Province, Russia, had the highest overall performance, with an average score of 70.8\%, while providers in Albania and Tajikistan had the lowest average score, each at 50.8\%. The {CPV} vignettes with the lowest scores were for multiple noncommunicable disease risk factors and birth asphyxia. A considerable proportion (11\%) of providers performed well on the {CPV} vignettes, regardless of country, facility, or structural resources available to them. Conclusions: Countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia are challenged by poor performance as measured by clinical care vignettes, but there is potential for provision of high-quality care by a sizable proportion of providers. Large-scale assessments of quality of care have been hampered by the lack of effective measurement tools that provide generalizable and reliable results across diverse economic, cultural, and social settings. The feasibility of quality measurement using {CPV} vignettes in these 6 countries and the ability to combine results with individual feedback could significantly enhance strategies to improve quality of care, and ultimately population health. © Peabody et al.},

	abstract = {Background The aim of this study was to construct a wealth index that could be compared over time in order to understand the trends in wealth in Kenya and determine predictors of change in wealth index. Methods Data were from the Demographic and Health Survey program collected in Kenya between 1993 and 2009. Variable categories were collapsed to match and factor analysis was performed on the 4-year pooled data to generate a harmonized wealth index. Possible predictors of wealth were selected from household variables available for all 4 years. Household sampling weights and stratification by rural/urban was used. Results Overall, wealth increased in Kenya between 1993 and 2008; however, when stratified, no significant increase existed in urban areas and a significant increase was identified in rural areas specifically between 2003 and 2008. The strongest predictor was education, with more than a standard deviation difference for secondary or higher levels of education over those with no education. The association of gender of the head of household and whether the head of household had a partner differed between rural and urban areas, with household heads who were women and those who had a partner having more wealth in urban areas but less wealth in rural areas. Conclusion Wealth in Kenya increased over time, specifically in rural regions. Differences were identified in predictors of wealth by urban/rural residence, educational level, and gender of the head of household and should be taken into account when planning interventions to target those in disproportionately low wealth brackets. © 2017 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai},

	abstract = {Urban deprivation is an epistemic tool to study the geographic concentration of deprivation in different neighborhoods of a city. Studies have long associated with neighborhood research and have viewed it from multiple perspectives. Most of these researches look into ways how other factors affect a neighborhood or how a neighborhood affects other factors, commonly using global statistical measures to make inferences that only give a summation of local variations. However, in tune with Lewis Mumford’ contention, this article proposes a local measure based index of deprivation that not only gives a neighborhood level results but also takes neighboring effects into consideration. Neighboring effects maintain that a locality seldom exists as a discrete entity rather its characteristic is made up as an amalgamation of multiple characteristics of the contiguous localities. Thus, in this study, an Index of deprivation is devised for the municipal wards of Kolkata city using Geographically Weighted Principal Component Analysis ({GWPCA}) loadings and compared to that devised from Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) loadings. It is found that {GWPCA} accounts effectively for local variations and neighboring effects at the neighborhood scale. However, both the Indices have pinpointed particular wards that are at the extreme end of the urban deprivation scale irrespective of the measure used. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Design: Cross-sectional structured interviews. Setting: Pwani Region, Tanzania. Participants: The study includes 24 rural, government-managed, primary healthcare clinics and their catchment populations. From January-April 2016, we conducted a household survey of a census of women with recent deliveries, health worker knowledge surveys and facility audits. Main Outcome Measures: We explored the proportion of women receiving quality care through the cascade and conducted an equity analysis by wealth. Results: In total, 2,910 of 3,564 women (81.6\%) reported delivering their most recent child in a health facility, 1,096 of whom delivered in a study facility. Using a minimum threshold of quality, the effective coverage of obstetric care was 25\%. Quality was lowest in the emergency care dimensions, with the average score on the provider knowledge tests at 47\% and the average provision of basic emergency obstetric services below 50\%. The wealthiest 20\% of women were 4.1 times as likely to deliver in facilities offering at least the minimum threshold of quality care through the cascade compared to the poorest 80\% of women (95\% confidence interval: 1.5-11.3). Conclusions: Effective coverage of delivery care is very low, particularly among poorer women. Health worker knowledge caused the sharpest decline in effective coverage. Measures of effective coverage are a better performance measure of under-resourced health systems than utilization. Equity analyses can further identify important discrepancies in quality across socio-economic levels. © The Author 2016.},

Objectives: This study evaluates the current coverage and completeness of reported malaria parasitological testing data in {DHIS}2 specifically looking at patterns in geographic coverage of public health facilities in Kenya. Methods: Monthly facility level data on malaria parasitological testing were extracted from Kenya {DHIS}2 between November 2015 and October 2016. {DHIS}2 public facilities were matched to a geo-coded master facility list to obtain coordinates. Coverage was defined as the geographic distribution of facilities reporting any data by region. Completeness of reporting was defined as the percentage of facilities reporting any data for the whole 12-month period or for 3, 6 and 9 months. Results: Public health facilities were 5,933 (59\%) of 10,090 extracted. Fifty-nine per Cent of the public facilities did not report any data while 36, 29 and 22\% facilities had data reported at least 3, 6 and 9 months, respectively. Only 8\% of public facilities had data reported for every month. There were proportionately more hospitals (86\%) than health centres (76\%) and dispensaries/clinics (30\%) reporting. There were significant geographic variations in reporting rates. Counties along the malaria endemic coast had the lowest reporting rate with only 1\% of facilities reporting consistently for 12 months. Conclusion: Current coverage and completeness of reporting of malaria parasitological diagnosis across Kenya’s public health system remains poor. The usefulness of routine data to improve our understanding of sub-national heterogeneity across Kenya would require significant improvements to the consistency and coverage of data captured by {DHIS}2. © 2017 The Author(s).

Health systems in lower- and middle-income countries are not designed for chronic health care, yet the rising burden of noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes demands chronic care services. To inform policies on diabetes care, we conducted a study on the health services in place to diagnose, treat and care for diabetes patients in rural Tanzania. The study was an exploratory and descriptive study involving qualitative methods (in-depth interviews, observations and document reviews) and was conducted in a rural district in Tanzania. Fifteen health providers in four health facilities at different levels of the health care system were interviewed. The health care organization elements of the Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions ({ICCC}) framework were used to guide assessment of the diabetes services in the district. We found that diabetes care in this district was centralized at the referral and district facilities, with unreliable supply of necessary commodities for diabetes care and health providers who had some knowledge of what was expected of them but felt ill-prepared for diabetes care. Facility and district level guidance was lacking and the continuity of care was broken within and between facilities. The {HMIS} could not produce reliable data on diabetes. Support for selfmanagement to patients and their families was weak at all levels. In conclusion, the rural district we studied did not provide diabetes care close to the patients. Guidance on diabetes service provision and human resource management need strengthening and policies related to task-shifting need adjustment to improve quality of service provision for diabetes patients in rural settings. © The Author 2016.},

Objectives To summarise the existing knowledge regarding cancer in the Solomon Islands, to gather new data and make recommendations. Methods A literature review was undertaken and cancer data from the National Referral Hospital, Honiara were analysed and are presented. Key stakeholders were interviewed for their perspectives including areas to target for ongoing, incremental improvements. Last, a health services audit for cancer using the {WHO} {SARA} tool was undertaken. Results Breast and cervical cancer remain the first and second most commonly identified cancers in the Solomon Islands. The Solomons cancer registry is hospital based and suffers from incomplete data collection due to its passive nature, lack of resources for data entry and processing resulting in weak data which is rarely used for decision-making. The health system audit revealed system and individual reasons for delayed diagnosis or lack of cancer treatment or palliation in the Solomon Islands. Reasons included lack of patient knowledge regarding symptoms, late referrals to the National Referral Hospital and inability of health care workers to detect cancers either due to lack of skills to do so, or lack of diagnostic capabilities, and an overall lack of access to any health care, due to geographical barriers and overall national economic fragility. Conclusion The Solomon Islands is challenged in preventing, diagnosing, treating and palliating cancer. Stakeholders recommend establishing specialty expertise (in the form of a cancer unit), improved registry processes and increased collaboration between the sole tertiary hospital nationwide and other Solomon health services as important targets for incremental improvement. © 2017},

	abstract = {Background: Faith-based non-profit ({FBNP}) providers have had a long-standing role as non-state, non-profit providers in the Ghanaian health system. They have historically been considered to be important in addressing the inequitable geographical distribution of health services and towards the achievement of universal health coverage ({UHC}), but in changing contexts, this contribution is being questioned. However, any assessment of contribution is hampered by the lack of basic information about their comparative presence and coverage in the Ghanaian health system. In response, since the 1950s, there have been repeated calls for the 'mapping' of faith-based health assets. Methods: A historically-focused mixed-methods study was conducted, collecting qualitative and quantitative data and combining geospatial mapping with varied documentary resources (secondary and primary, current and archival). Geospatial maps were developed, providing a visual representation of changes in the spatial footprint of the Ghanaian {FBNP} health sector. Results: The geospatial maps show that {FBNPs} were originally located in rural remote areas of the country but that this service footprint has evolved over time, in line with changing social, political and economic contexts. Conclusion: {FBNPs} have had a long-standing role in the provision of health services and remain a valuable asset within national health systems in Ghana and sub-Saharan Africa more broadly. Collaboration between the public sector and such non-state providers, drawing on the comparative strengths and resources of {FBNPs} and focusing on whole system strengthening, is essential for the achievement of {UHC}. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Antenatal care ({ANC}) is provided for free in Tanzania in all public health facilities. Yet surveys suggested that long distances to the facilities limit women from accessing these services. Mobile health clinics ({MHC}) were introduced to address this problem; however, little is known about the client cost and time associated with utilizing {ANC} at {MHC} and whether these costs deter women from using the provided services. Methods: Client-exit interviews were conducted by interviewing 293 pregnant women who visited the {MHC} in rural Tanzania. Two subgroups were created, one with women who travelled more than 1.5 h to the {MHC}, and the other with women who travelled within 1.5 h. For each subgroup we estimated the direct cost in {US}\$ and time in hours for utilizing services and they hinder service utilization. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test was performed to compare the differences between the estimated mean values in the two groups. Result: Total direct cost per visit was: {US}\$2.27 ({SD} = 0.90) for overall, {US}\$2.29 ({SD} = 1.03) for those women who travelled less than 1.5 h and {US}\$2.53 ({SD} = 0.63) for those who travelled more than 1.5 h (p = 0.08). Laboratory and medicine cost accounted for 70 and 16\% of the total direct cost and were similar across the groups. Total time cost per visit (in hours) was: 3.75 ({SD} = 1.83), 2.88 ({SD} = 1.27) for those women who travelled less than 1.5 h and 5.02 ({SD} = 1.81) for those who travelled more than 1.5 h (p {\textless} 0.01). The major contributor of time cost was waiting time; 1.89 ({SD} = 1.29) for overall, 1.68 ({SD} = 1.02) for those women who travelled less than 1.5 h and 2.17 ({SD} = 1.57) for those who travelled more than 1.5 h (p = 0.07). Participants reported having missed their scheduled visit due to lack of money (15\%) and time (9\%). Conclusion: Women receiving nominally free {ANC} incur considerable time and direct cost, which may result in an unsteady use of maternal care. Improving availability of essential medicine and supplies at health facilities, as well as focusing on efficient utilization of community health workers may reduce these costs. © 2018 The Author(s).},

Sierra Leone is a West African country with close to three million children. It is unknown to what extent the surgical needs of these children are met. Aim: To describe a nationwide provision of pediatric surgical procedures and to assess pediatric hernia repair as a proxy indicator for the shortage of surgical care in the pediatric population in Sierra Leone. Methods: We analyzed results from a nationwide facility survey in Sierra Leone that collected data on surgical procedures from operation and anesthesia logbooks in all facilities performing surgery. We included data on all patients under the age of 16 years undergoing surgery. Primary outcomes were rate and volume of surgical procedures. We calculated the expected number of inguinal hernia in children and estimated the unmet need for hernia repair. Results: In 2012, a total of 2381 pediatric surgical procedures were performed in Sierra Leone. The rate of pediatric surgical procedures was 84 per 100,000 children 0–15 years of age. The most common pediatric surgical procedure was hernia repair (18\%), corresponding to a rate of 16 per 100,000 children 0–15 years of age. The estimated unmet need for inguinal hernia repair was 88\%. Conclusions: The rate of pediatric surgery in Sierra Leone was very low, and inguinal hernia was the single most common procedure noted among children in Sierra Leone. © 2017, The Author(s).},

Methods: We used three rounds of {DHS} data from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda to examine time trends from 1999 to 2015 in met need for modern contraception, method mix, and source of care by sector (public or private) and type of provider among young women aged 15-24 years. We assessed disparities in contraceptive coverage improvements over time between younger (15-24 years) and older women (25-49 years) using a difference-in-differences approach. Results: Met need for contraception among women aged 15-24 years increased over time, ranging from a 20\% increase in Tanzania to more than a 5-fold increase in Rwanda. Improvements in met need were greater among older women compared to younger women in Rwanda and Uganda, and higher among younger women in Kenya. Injectables have become the most popular contraceptive choice among young women, with more than 50\% of modern contraceptive users aged 15-24 years currently using the method in all countries except for Tanzania, where condoms and injectables are used by 38\% and 35\% of young users, respectively. More than half of young women in Tanzania and Uganda receive contraceptives from the private sector; however, while the private sector played an important role in meeting the growing contraceptive needs among young women in Tanzania, increased use of public sector services drove expanded access in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Conclusions: Our study shows that contraceptive use increased among young East African women, yet, unmet need remains high. As youth populations continue to grow, governments must develop more targeted strategies for expanding access to reproductive health services for young women. Engaging the private sector and task-shifting to lower-level providers offer promising approaches; however, additional research is needed to identify the key facilitators and barriers to the success of these strategies in different contexts. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction Zambia is one of the few countries in Africa to permit termination of pregnancy ({TOP}) on a wide range of grounds. However, substantial barriers remain to {TOP} and postabortion care ({PAC}). Methods We conducted a census of 153 facilities between March and May 2016. We defined facilities according to whether they met basic and/or comprehensive signal functions criteria for {TOP} and {PAC}. We linked our facility data to census data to estimate geographic accessibility under different policy scenarios. results Overall, 16\% of facilities reported they had performed a {TOP} and 39\% performed a {PAC} in the last year. Facilities were twice as likely to use medical methods for {TOP} compared with surgical methods, and four times more likely for {PAC}. Considerably more facilities had performed {TOP} or {PAC} than met the basic or comprehensive signal functions criteria, indicating services were being performed in facilities below essential quality standards. Under current Zambian law for non-emergency scenarios, 21\% of women in Central Province lived within 15 km of a facility with basic capability to provide {TOP}; if midlevel providers were trained to provide {TOP}, this would increase to 36\%. Conclusion A supportive legislative framework is essential, but not in itself sufficient, for adequate access to services. Training midlevel providers, in line with {WHO} guidance, and ensuring equipment is available in primary care can increase accessibility of {TOP} and {PAC}. While both medical and surgical methods need to be available, medical abortion is a safe and effective method that can be provided in low-resource settings. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

	abstract = {Background: Non-communicable diseases ({NCDs}) are increasing in prevalence in low-income countries including Uganda. The Uganda Ministry of Health has prioritized {NCD} prevention, early diagnosis, and management. However, research on the capacity of public sector health facilities to address {NCDs} is limited. Methods: We developed a survey guided by the literature and the standards of the World Health Organization Pacakage of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions for Primary Health Care in Low-Resource Settings. We used this tool to conduct a needs assessment in 53 higher-level public sector facilities throughout Uganda, including all Regional Referral Hospitals ({RRH}) and a purposive sample of General Hospitals ({GH}) and Health Centre {IVs} ({HCIV}), to: (1) assess their capacity to detect and manage {NCDs}; (2) describe provider knowledge and practices regarding the management of {NCDs}; and (3) identify areas in need of focused improvement. We collected data on human resources, equipment, {NCD} screening and management, medicines, and laboratory tests. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize our findings. Results: We identified significant resource gaps at all sampled facilities. All facilities reported deficiencies in {NCD} screening and management services. Less than half of all {RRH} and {GH} had an automated blood pressure machine. The only laboratory test uniformly available at all surveyed facilities was random blood glucose. Sub-specialty {NCD} clinics were available in some facilities with the most common type being a diabetes clinic present at eleven (85\%) {RRHs}. These facilities offered enhanced services to patients with diabetes. Surveyed facilities had limited use of {NCD} patient registries and {NCD} management guidelines. Most facilities (46\% {RRH}, 23\% {GH}, 7\% {HCIV}) did not track patients with {NCDs} by using registries and only 4 (31\%) {RRHs}, 4 (15\%) {GHs}, and 1 (7\%) {HCIVs} had access to diabetes management guidelines. Conclusions: Despite inter-facility variability, none of the facilities in our study met the {WHO}-{PEN} standards for essential tools and medicines to implement effective {NCD} interventions. In Uganda, improvements in the allocation of human resources and essential medicines and technologies, coupled with uptake in the use of quality assurance modalities are desperately needed in order to adequately address the rapidly growing {NCD} burden. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Despite years of growing concern about poor provider attitudes and women experiencing mistreatment during facility based childbirth, there are limited interventions that specifically focus on addressing these issues. The Heshima project is an evidence-based participatory implementation research study conducted in 13 facilities in Kenya. It engaged a range of community, facility, and policy stakeholders to address the causes of mistreatment during childbirth and promote respectful maternity care. Methods: We used the consolidated framework for implementation research ({CFIR}) as an analytical lens to describe a complex, multifaceted set of interventions through a reflexive and iterative process for triangulating qualitative data. Data from a broad range of project documents, reports, and interviews were collected at different time points during the implementation of Heshima. Assessment of in-depth interview data used {NVivo} (Version 10) and Atlas.ti software to inductively derive codes for themes at baseline, supplemental, and endline. Our purpose was to generate categories of themes for analysis found across the intervention design and implementation stages. Results: The implementation process, intervention characteristics, individual champions, and inner and outer settings influenced both Heshima's successes and challenges at policy, facility, and community levels. Implementation success stemmed from readiness for change at multiple levels, constant communication between stakeholders, and perceived importance to communities. The relative advantage and adequacy of implementation of the Respectful Maternity Care ({RMC}) resource package was meaningful within Kenyan politics and health policy, given the timing and national promise to improve the quality of maternity care. Conclusion: We found the {CFIR} lens a promising and flexible one for understanding the complex interventions. Despite the relatively nascent stage of {RMC} implementation research, we feel this study is an important start to understanding a range of interventions that can begin to address issues of mistreatment in maternity care; replication of these activities is needed globally to better understand if the Heshima implementation process can be successful in different countries and regions. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Performance-based financing ({PBF}) is assumed to improve health care delivery by motivating health workers to enhance their work performance. However, the exact motivational mechanisms through which {PBF} is assumed to produce such changes are poorly understood to date. Although {PBF} is increasingly recognized as a complex health systems intervention, its motivational effect for individual health workers is still often reduced to financial 'carrots and sticks' in the literature and discourse. Aiming to contribute to the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the motivational mechanisms, we explored how {PBF} impacted health worker motivation in the context of the Malawian Results-based Financing for Maternal and Newborn Health ({RBF}4MNH) Initiative. We conducted in-depth interviews with 41 nurses, medical assistants and clinical officers from primary- and secondary-level health facilities 1 and 2 years after the introduction of {RBF}4MNH in 2013. Six categories of motivational mechanisms emerged: {RBF}4MNH motivated health workers to improve their performance (1) by acting as a periodic wake-up call to deficiencies in their day-to-day practice; (2) by providing direction and goals to work towards; (3) by strengthening perceived ability to perform successfully at work and triggering a sense of accomplishment; (4) by instilling feelings of recognition; (5) by altering social dynamics, improving team work towards a common goal, but also introducing social pressure; and (6) by offering a 'nice to have' opportunity to earn extra income. However, respondents also perceived weaknesses of the intervention design, implementation-related challenges and contextual constraints that kept {RBF}4MNH from developing its full motivating potential. Our results underline {PBF}'s potential to affect health workers' motivation in ways which go far beyond the direct effects of financial rewards to individuals. We strongly recommend considering all motivational mechanisms more explicitly in future {PBF} design to fully exploit the approach's capacity for enhancing health worker performance. © 2017 The Author.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Only 20\% of the surgical burden in eastern sub-Saharan Africa is currently met, leaving {\textgreater}17 million surgical cases annually in need of safe surgery and anesthesia. Similarly, there is an extreme shortage of anesthesia providers in East Africa, with just 0.44 anesthesiologists per 100,000 people in Kenya compared to 20.82 per 100,000 in the United States. Additionally, surgical access is not equally distributed within countries, with rural settings often having the greatest unmet need. We developed and tested a set of tools to assess if graduates of the Kenya registered nurse anesthetist ({KRNA}) training program, who were placed in rural hospitals in Kenya, would have any impact on surgical numbers, referral patterns, and economics of these hospitals. {METHODS}: Cross-sectional data were collected from facility assessments in 9 referral hospitals to evaluate the possible impact of the {KRNAs} on anesthesia care. The hospitals were grouped based on both the number of beds and the assigned national hospital level. At each level, a hospital that had {KRNA} graduates (intervention) was matched with comparison hospitals in the same category with no {KRNA} graduates (control). The facility assessment survey included questions capturing data on personnel, infrastructure, supplies, medications, procedures, and outcomes. At the intervention sites, the medical directors of the hospitals and the {KRNAs} were interviewed. Descriptive statistics were used to present the findings. {RESULTS}: Intervention sites had a density of anesthesia providers that was 43\% higher compared to the control sites. Intervention sites performed at least twice as many surgical cases compared to the control sites. Most {KRNAs} stated that the anesthesia training program had given them sufficient training and leadership skills to perform safe anesthesia in their clinical practice setting. Medical directors at the intervention sites reported increased surgical volumes and fewer referrals to larger hospitals due to the anesthesia gaps that had been addressed. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings from this study suggest that {KRNAs} may be associated with an increased volume of surgical cases completed in these rural Kenyan hospitals and may therefore be filling a known anesthetic void. The presence of skilled anesthesia providers is a first step toward providing safe surgery and anesthesia care for all; however, significant gaps still remain. Future analysis will focus on surgical outcomes, the appropriate anesthesia delivery model for a rural population, and how the availability of anesthesia infrastructure impacts referral patterns and safe surgery capacity. © 2019 International Anesthesia Research Society.},

We statistically and spatially examined six environmental variables (ultrafine particles, carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic pollutants, pollution released to air, tree cover, and walkability index), six health service indicators (number health providers, breast, colorectal and cervical cancer screening uptake rates, student nutrition program uptake rates, and healthy food index), and eight socioeconomic indicators (total income, Gini coefficient, two age categories – below and above 40 years, proportion of females to males, visible minorities, Indigenous peoples, education, less than grade 9) among 140 neighbourhoods of the City of Toronto in Ontario (Canada). We applied principal component analysis to identify patterns and to reduce the number of explanatory variables into combined component axes that represent unique variation in these confounded and overlapping factors. We then applied regression analysis to model the relationship between the indices of enviro-health and socioeconomics and their potential relationship with premature mortality. Residual spatial analysis was used to investigate any remaining spatial structure (such as neighbourhoods with higher residual premature mortality rates). Neighbourhood Equity Index was correlated with our enviro-health and socioeconomic indices. Premature mortality within neighbourhoods was predicted by poor cancer screenings, pollution, lack of tree canopy, increased uptake of student nutrition programs and high walkability index. A negative association between premature mortality and pollution was associated low walkability index and presence of visible minorities within neighbourhoods. There was some unexplained residual spatial variation in our model of premature mortality - especially along the shores of Lake Ontario and in neighbourhoods with major highways or road corridors: premature mortality in Toronto neighbourhoods was higher than expected along highway-corridor neighbourhoods and shorelines. Our analysis revealed a significant relationship between neighbourhood contextual features – both environmental and health – and premature mortality, suggesting that these contextual components of neighbourhoods can predict rates of urban premature mortality in Toronto. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: The goal of universal health coverage ({UHC}) requires that everyone receive needed health services, and that families who get needed services do not suffer undue financial hardship. Tracking progress towards {UHC} requires measurement of both these dimensions, and a way of trading them off against one another. Methods: We measured service coverage by a weighted geometric average of four prevention indicators (antenatal care, full immunisation, and screening for breast and cervical cancers) and four treatment indicators (skilled birth attendance, inpatient admission, and treatment for acute respiratory infection and diarrhoea), financial protection by the incidence of catastrophic health expenditures (those exceeding 10\% of household consumption or income), and a country's {UHC} performance as a geometric average of the service coverage index and the complement of the incidence of catastrophic expenditures. Where possible, we adjusted service coverage for inequality, penalising countries with a high level of inequality. The bulk of data used in this study were from the World Bank's Health Equity and Financial Protection Indicators database (2019 version), comprising data from household surveys. Gaps in the data were supplemented with other survey data and (where necessary) non-survey data from other sources (administrative, modelled, and imputed data). Findings: A low incidence of catastrophic expenses sometimes reflects low service coverage (often in low-income countries) but sometimes occurs despite high service coverage (often in high-income countries). At a given level of service coverage, financial protection also varies. {UHC} index scores are generally higher in higher-income countries, but there are variations within income groups. Adjusting the {UHC} index for inequality in service coverage makes little difference in some countries, but reduces it by more than 10\% in others. Seven of the 12 countries for which we were able to produce trend data have increased their {UHC} index over time (with the greatest average yearly increases seen in Ghana [1·43\%], Indonesia [1·85\%], and Vietnam [2·26\%]), mostly by improving both financial protection and service coverage. Some increased their {UHC} index, despite reductions in financial protection, by substantially increasing their service coverage. The {UHC} index decreased in five of 12 countries with trend data, mostly because financial protection worsened with stagnant or declining service coverage. Our {UHC} indicators (except inpatient admissions) are significantly and positively associated with {GDP} per capita, and most are correlated with the share of health spending channelled through social health insurance and government schemes. However, associations of our {UHC} indicators with the share of {GDP} spent on health and the shares of health spending channelled through non-profit and private insurance are ambiguous. Interpretation: Progress towards {UHC} can be tracked using an index that captures both service coverage and financial protection. Although per-capita income is a good predictor of a country's {UHC} index score, some countries perform better than others in the same income group or even in the income group above their own. Strong {UHC} performance is correlated with the share of a country's health budget that is channelled through government and social health insurance schemes. Funding: None. © 2020 The World Bank.

	abstract = {Introduction: Countries with high maternal and newborn mortality can benefit from national facility level data that describe intra-facility emergency referral patterns for major obstetric complications. This paper assesses the relationship between referral and facilities' readiness to treat complications at each level of the health system in Ghana. We also investigate other facility characteristics associated with referral. Methods: The National Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care Assessment 2010 provided aggregated information from 977 health facilities. Readiness was defined in a 2-step process: availability of a health worker who could provide life-saving interventions and a minimum package of drugs, supplies, and equipment to perform the interventions. The second step mapped interventions to major obstetric complications. We used descriptive statistics and simple linear regression. Results: Lower level facilities were likely to refer nearly all women with complications. District hospitals resolved almost two-thirds of all complicated cases, referring 9\%. The most prevalent indications for referral were prolonged/obstructed labor and antepartum hemorrhage. Readiness to treat a complication was correlated with a reduction in referral for all complications except uterine rupture. Facility readiness was low: roughly 40\% of hospitals and 10\% of lower level facilities met the readiness threshold. Facilities referred fewer women when they had higher caseloads, more midwives, better infrastructure, and systems of communication and transport. Discussion: Understanding how deliveries and obstetric complications are distributed across the health system helps policy makers contextualize decisions about the pathways to providing maternity services. Improving conditions for referral (by increasing access to communication and transport systems) and the management of obstetric complications (increasing readiness) will enhance quality of care and make referral more effective and efficient. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective To assess adoption of World Health Organization ({WHO}) guidance into national policies for prevention of mother-to-child transmission ({PMTCT}) of human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) and to monitor implementation of guidelines at facility level in rural Malawi, South Africa and the United Republic of Tanzania. Methods We summarized national {PMTCT} policies and {WHO} guidance for 15 indicators across the cascades of maternal and infant care over 2013–2016. Two survey rounds were conducted (2013–2015 and 2015–2016) in 46 health facilities serving five health and demographic surveillance system populations. We administered structured questionnaires to facility managers to describe service delivery. We report the proportions of facilities implementing each indicator and the frequency and durations of stock-outs of supplies, by site and survey round. Findings In all countries, national policies influencing the maternal and infant {PMTCT} cascade of care aligned with {WHO} guidelines by 2016; most inter-country policy variations concerned linkage to routine {HIV} care. The proportion of facilities delivering post-test counselling, same-day antiretroviral therapy ({ART}) initiation, antenatal care and {ART} provision in the same building, and Option B+ increased or remained at 100\% in all sites. Progress in implementing policies on infant diagnosis and treatment varied across sites. Stock-outs of {HIV} test kits or antiretroviral drugs in the past year declined overall, but were reported by at least one facility per site in both rounds. Conclusion Progress has been made in implementing {PMTCT} policy in these settings. However, persistent gaps across the infant cascade of care and supply-chain challenges, risk undermining infant {HIV} elimination goals. © 2019, World Health Organization. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Monitoring and evaluation of health system reforms are essential to ensure the achievement of their objectives. The latest heath sector reform in the Islamic Republic of Iran, namely, the Health Transformation Plan ({HTP}), was launched in 2014 and the country is embarking on the {HTP} to achieve universal health coverage ({UHC}). Aims: The study aimed to develop the most appropriate monitoring and evaluation framework for the {HTP} in accordance with national and global goals and priorities, and to identify data gaps in its monitoring and evaluation. Method: A case study and evidence-based approach was applied to develop the monitoring and evaluation framework. The model that was proposed jointly by the World Bank and the World Health Organization for monitoring and evaluation of {UHC} was used as the basis for the potential list of the indicators and key policy documents were reviewed, accordingly. The framework formulation process was carried out through a series of meetings with experts and senior managers working at the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, whose perspectives on the frameworks functionality and usage were regarded as valuable. The final draft was presented to policy-makers for input and approval. Results: A data mapping revealed that at least nine national surveys were required to obtain the indicators for effective monitoring. At the time of framework designing, many indicators were not available or had not been updated for several years due to lack of available and appropriate data sources. Conclusions: Results indicated that the country’s health information system had many information gaps that should be filled to enable the tracking of {UHC} goals and measuring the success of the plan. Applying the proposed framework would increase the comparability of the country’s health indicators at the global level and specify a path to successfully achieve the objectives of the reform. © World Health Organization ({WHO}) 2019.

	abstract = {Background: Despite the legalization of abortion services in 2002, unsafe abortion (abortion services conducted by persons lacking necessary skill or in substandard settings or both) continues to be a public health concern in Nepal. There is a lack of national research exploring the characteristics of women who choose to have an abortion. This study assessed abortion in Nepal and its correlates using data from a nationally representative population-based cross-sectional survey. Methods: We employed data from the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2016. Sample selection was based on stratified two-stage cluster sampling in rural areas and three-stage sampling in urban areas. The primary outcome is report of induced abortion in the 5 years preceding the survey, as recorded in the pregnancy history. All values were weighted by sample weights to provide population-level estimates. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed using {STATA} 14 considering cluster sampling design. Results: A total of 12,862 women of reproductive age (15-49 years) were interviewed. Overall, 4\% (95\% {CI}: 3.41-4.29) reported an abortion within the last 5 years (and less than 1\% had had more than one abortion during that time). A higher proportion of women aged 20-34 years (5.7\%), women with primary education (5.1\%), women aware of abortion legalization (5.5\%), and women in the richest wealth quintile (5.4\%) had an abortion in the past 5 years. Compared to women aged {\textless} 20 years, women aged 20-34 years had higher odds ({AOR}: 5.54; 95\% {CI}: 2.87-10.72) of having had an abortion in the past 5 years. Women with three or more living children had greater odds ({AOR}: 2.24; 95\% {CI}: 1.51-3.31) of having had an abortion than women with no living children. The odds of having an abortion in the past 5 years increased with each wealth quintile, with the richest wealth quintile having almost three-fold greater odds of having had an abortion. No significant association was observed between having an abortion and the ecological zone and place of residence. Conclusion: This nationally representative study shows that abortion is associated with women's age, knowledge of abortion legality, wealth status, number of living children, and caste/ethnicity. Targeted interventions to young women, those in the poorest wealth quintile, women from Terai caste groups, and those who reside in Province 2 would be instrumental to address disproportional access to abortion services. Overall, strengthening contraceptive provision and abortion education programs would be cornerstone to improving the health of women and girls in Nepal. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Aims: To assess the knowledge of nurses of national guidelines for emergency maternity, routine newborn and small and sick newborn care in Nairobi County, Kenya. Background: The vast majority of women deliver in a health facility in Nairobi. Yet, maternal and neonatal mortality remain high. Ensuring competency of health workers, in providing essential maternal and newborn interventions in health facilities will be key if further progress is to be made in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality in low-resource settings. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Methods: Questionnaires comprised of clinical vignettes and direct questions and were administered in 2015–2016 to nurses (n = 125 in 31 facilities) on duty in maternity and newborn units in public and private facilities providing 24/7 inpatient neonatal services. Composite knowledge scores were calculated and presented as weighted means. Associations were explored using regression. {STROBE} guidelines were followed. Results: Nurses scored best for knowledge on active management of the mother after birth and immediate routine newborn care. Performance was worst for questions on infant resuscitation, checking signs and symptoms of sick newborns, and managing hypertension in pregnancy. Overall knowledge of care for sick newborns was particularly low (score 0.62 of 1). Across all areas assessed, nurses who had received training since qualifying performed better than those who had not. Poorly resourced and low case-load facilities had lower average knowledge scores compared with better-resourced and busier facilities. Conclusion: Overall, we estimate that 31\% of maternity patients, 3\% of newborns and 39\% of small and sick newborns are being cared for in an environment where nursing knowledge is very low (score {\textless}0.6). Relevance to clinical practice: Focus on periodic training, ensuring retention of knowledge and skills among health workers in low-case load setting, and bridging the know-do gap may help to improve the quality of care delivered to mothers and newborns in Kenya. © 2018 The Authors Journal of Clinical Nursing Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Introduction: Nepal has pledged to substantially reduce maternal and newborn death by 2030. Improving quality of intrapartum health services will be vital to reduce these deaths. This paper examines quality of delivery and newborn services in health facilities of Nepal. Methods: Data were sourced from the Nepal Health Facility Survey 2015, which covered a national representative sample of health facilities. The datasets were analysed to assess service readiness, availability and quality of delivery and newborn care in a sample of 992 health facilities. Results: Of the 992 facilities in the sample, 623 provided delivery and newborn care services. Of the 623 facilities offering delivery and newborn care services, 13.3\% offered comprehensive emergency obstetric care ({CEmONC}), 19.6\% provided basic emergency obstetric care ({BEmONC}) and 53.9\% provided basic delivery and newborn service. The availability of essential equipment for delivery and newborn care was more than 80\% in health facilities. Except for the coverage of vitamin K injection, the coverage of immediate newborn care was more than 85\% in all health facilities. The coverage of use of chlorhexidine ointment to all newborns was more than 70\% in government hospitals and primary health care centers ({PHCCs}) and only 32.3\% in private hospitals. Conclusions: These findings show gaps in equipment and drugs, especially in {PHCCs} and private health facilities. Improving readiness and availability of equipment and drugs in {PHCCs} and private health facility will help improve the quality of care to further reduce maternal and newborn mortality in Nepal. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Globally, women face many barriers in the attainment of sexual and reproductive health and rights ({SRHR}). Since 2002, the legalisation of abortion in Nepal has seen significant progress in the expansion of safe abortion and family planning services. Methods: This qualitative, exploratory study was conducted in 2014 and uses nine in-depth, open-ended interviews with a cross-section of {SRHR} professionals, to explore their perspectives on abortion in Nepal. The study was underpinned by the Assets Focused Rapid Participatory Appraisal ({AFRPA}) research methodology and used the health information pyramid conceptual framework. Results: Thematic content analysis revealed emerging themes relating to barriers to access and uptake of skilled safe abortion services and post-abortion family planning. Findings also emphasised current practical and legal components relating to the provision of medical abortion through pharmacies and highlighted issues of sex-selective abortion within the predominantly patriarchal society. Conclusion: Effective and ongoing sector-wide monitoring and evaluation of safe abortion services and their staff is essential for women in Nepal to have adequate access to effective and efficient safe abortion services, access to contraception and sexual and reproductive health ({SRH}) information post-abortion and to ensure adherence to current Safe Abortion Policy. It is critical that the unsafe (less and least safe) provision of medical abortion through pharmacies and sex-selective abortion continues to be investigated and that innovative strategies are formulated to ensure the cultural, reproductive and sexual health and rights of Nepali women are realised. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Although Nepal legalised abortion in 2002, a significant number of women continue to access unsafe abortions. An estimated 60\% of all abortions performed in 2014 were unsafe, with unsafe abortion continuing to be a leading contributor to maternal mortality. Despite medical abortion access being solely permitted through government accredited safe abortion services, medical abortion pills are readily available for illegal purchase at pharmacies throughout the country. Methods: Utilising an Assets Focused Rapid Participatory Appraisal ({AFRPA}) research methodology, underpinned by a health information pyramid conceptual framework, this qualitative exploratory study collected data from in-depth, open-ended interviews. The study explored the medical abortion and sexual and reproductive health experiences of ten women who accessed medical abortion through an accredited safe abortion service, and ten women who accessed unsafe medical abortion through pharmacies. Results: Thematic content analysis revealed emerging themes relating to decision-making processes in accessing safe or unsafe medical abortion; knowledge of safe abortion services; and {SRH} information access and post-abortion contraceptive counselling. Findings emphasised the interconnectivity of sexual and reproductive health and rights; reproductive coercion; education; poverty; spousal separation; and women's personal, social and economic empowerment. Conclusions: While barriers to safe abortion services persist, so will the continued demand for medical abortion provision through pharmacies. Innovated and effective harm reduction implementations combined with access and information expansion strategies offer the potential to increase access to safe medical abortion while decreasing adverse health outcomes for women. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Over the past decade, prevalence of maternal and child morbidity and mortality in Togo, particularly in the northern regions, has remained high despite global progress. The causes of under-five child mortality in Togo are diseases with effective and low-cost prevention and/or treatment strategies, including malaria, acute lower respiratory infections, and diarrheal diseases. While Togo has a national strategy for implementing the integrated management of childhood illness ({IMCI}) guidelines, including a policy on integrated community case management ({iCCM}), challenges in implementation and low public sector health service utilization persist. There are critical gaps to access and quality of community health systems throughout the country. An integrated facility- and community-based initiative, the Integrated Community-Based Health Systems Strengthening ({ICBHSS}) initiative, seeks to address these gaps while strengthening the public sector health system in northern Togo. This study aims to evaluate the effect and implementation strategy of the {ICBHSS} initiative over 48 months in the catchment areas of 21 public sector health facilities. Methods: The {ICBHSS} model comprises a bundle of evidence-based interventions targeting children under five, women of reproductive age, and people living with {HIV} through (1) community engagement and feedback; (2) elimination of point-of-care costs; (3) proactive community-based {IMCI} using community health workers ({CHWs}) with additional services including family planning, {HIV} testing, and referrals; (4) clinical mentoring and enhanced supervision; and (5) improved supply chain management and facility structures. Using a pragmatic type {II} hybrid effectiveness-implementation study, we will evaluate the {ICBHSS} initiative with two primary aims: (1) determine effectiveness through changes in under-five mortality rates and (2) assess the implementation strategy through measures of reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. We will conduct a mixed-methods assessment using the {RE}-{AIM} (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework. This assessment consists of four components: (1) a stepped-wedge cluster randomized control trial using a community-based household survey, (2) annual health facility assessments, (3) key informant interviews, and (4) costing and return-on-investment assessments for each randomized cluster. Discussion: Our research is expected to contribute to continuous quality improvement initiatives, optimize implementation factors, provide knowledge regarding health service delivery, and accelerate health systems improvements in Togo and more broadly.

	abstract = {Background: Kenya has prioritized the attainment of universal health coverage ({UHC}) through the expansion of health insurance coverage by the National Hospital Insurance Fund ({NHIF}). In 2015, the {NHIF} introduced reforms in premium contribution rates, benefit packages, and provider payment methods. We examined the influence of these reforms on {NHIF}'s purchasing practices and their implications for strategic purchasing and health system goals of equity, efficiency and quality. Methods: We conducted an embedded case study with the {NHIF} as the case and the reforms as embedded units of analysis. We collected data at the national level and in two purposively selected counties through 41 in-depth interviews with health financing stakeholders, facility managers and frontline providers; 4 focus group discussions with 51 {NHIF} members; and, document reviews. We analysed the data using a Framework approach. Results: The new {NHIF} reforms were characterized by weak purchasing actions. Firstly, the new premium contribution rates were inadequately communicated and unaffordable for certain citizen groups. Secondly, while the new benefit packages were reported to be based on service needs, preferences and values of the population, they were inadequately communicated and unequally distributed across different citizen groups. In addition, the presence of service delivery infrastructure gaps in public healthcare facilities and the pro-urban and pro-private distribution of contracted health facilities compromised delivery of, and access to, these new services. Lastly, the new provider payment methods and rates were considered inadequate, with delayed payments and weak links to financial accountability mechanisms which compromised their ability to incentivize equity, efficiency and quality of healthcare delivery. Conclusion: While {NHIF} sought to expand population and service coverage and reduce out-of-pocket payments with the new reforms, weaknesses in the reforms' design and implementation limited {NHIF}'s purchasing actions with negative implications for the health system goals of equity, efficiency and quality. For the reforms to accelerate the country's progress towards {UHC}, policy makers at the {NHIF} and, national and county government should make deliberate efforts to align the design and implementation of such reforms with strategic purchasing actions that are aimed at improving health system goals. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Surgery is among the most neglected parts of healthcare systems in low-and middle-income countries. Ethiopia has launched a national strategic plan to address challenges in the surgical system. This study aimed to assess surgical capacity in two Ethiopian regions to inform priority areas for improvement. Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted using two tools adapted from the Lancet Commission’s Surgical Assessment Tools: a quantitative Hospital Assessment Tool and a qualitative semistructured interview tool. Fifteen hospitals selected by the Federal Ministry of Health were surveyed in the Tigray and Amhara regions to assess the surgical system across five domains: service delivery, infrastructure, workforce, information management and financing. Results: Service delivery was low across hospitals with a mean(s.d.) of 5(6) surgical cases per week and a narrow range of procedures performed. Hospitals reported varying availability of basic infrastructure, including constant availability of electricity (9 of 15) and running water (5 of 15). Unavailable or broken diagnostic equipment was also common. The majority of surgical and anaesthesia services were provided by non-physician clinicians, with little continuing education available. All hospitals tracked patient-level data regularly and eight of 15 hospitals reported surgical volume data during the assessment, but research activities were limited. Hospital financing specified for surgery was rare and the majority of patients must pay out of pocket for care. Conclusion: Results from this study will inform programmes to simultaneously improve each of the health system domains in Ethiopia; this is required if better access to and quality of surgery, anaesthesia and obstetric services are to be achieved. © 2019 {BJS} Society Ltd.},

	abstract = {Though Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao {PDR}) has made considerable progress in improving maternal and child health ({MCH}), significant disparities exist nationwide, with the poor and geographically isolated ethnic groups having limited access to services. In its pursuit of universal health coverage, the government introduced a Free {MCH} initiative in 2011, which has recently been subsumed within the new National Health Insurance ({NHI}) programme. Although this was a major national health financing reform, there have been few evaluations of the extent to which it improved equitable access to {MCH} services. We analyse surveys that provide information on demand-side and supply-side factors influencing access and utilization of free {MCH} services, especially for vulnerable groups. This includes two rounds of household surveys (2010 and 2013) in southern Lao {PDR} involving, respectively 2766 and 2911 women who delivered within 24 months prior to each survey. These data have been analysed according to the socio-economic status, geographic location and ethnicity of women using the {MCH} services as well as any associated out-of-pocket expenses and structural quality of these services. Two other surveys analysed here focused on human resources for health and structural quality of health facilities. Together, these data point to persistent large inequities in access and financial protection that need to be addressed. Significant differences were found in the utilization of health services by both economic status and ethnicity. Relatively large costs for institutional births were incurred by the poor and did not decline between 2010 and 2013 whereby there was no significant impact on financial protection. The overall benefit incidence of the universal programme was not pro-poor. The inequity was accentuated by issues related to distribution and nature of human resources, supply-side readiness and thus quality of care provided across different geographical areas. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

The purpose of our case study was to explore the knowledge and practices of health surveillance assistants operating at rural village health clinics in Ntcheu District, Malawi, with regard to the collection, segregation, transportion, treatment, and disposal of healthcare waste. Data were collected from 81 clinics. The results indicated that while general gaps in both knowledge and practice were observed, sharps (e.g., needles) management was generally being done well. An opportunity for scale-up was found in one clinic, in which local materials had been used to construct a low-cost innovative sharps disposal receptacle that had been modified from a pit latrine design. This study recommends waste management training suitable for rural settings, the promotion of low-cost sharps disposal receptacles using local materials, further opportunities for low-cost incinerators, central waste collection, and encouraging grassroots innovation in healthcare waste management. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland {AG}.},

	abstract = {Background: In Malawi, as in many low-and middle-income countries, health facility committees ({HFCs}) are involved in the governance of health services. Little is known about the approaches they use and the challenges they face. This study explores how {HFCs} monitor the quality of health services and how they demand accountability of health workers for their performance. Methods: Documentary analysis and key informant interviews (7) were complemented by interviews with purposefully selected {HFC} members (22) and health workers (40) regarding their experiences with {HFCs}. Data analysis was guided by a coding scheme informed by social accountability concepts complemented by inductive analysis to identify participants' perceptions and meanings of processes of social accountability facilitated by {HFCs}. Results: The results suggest that {HFCs} address poor health worker performance (such as absenteeism, poor treatments and informal payments), and report severe misconduct to health authorities. The informal and constructive approach that most {HFCs} use is shaped by formal definitions and common expectations of the role of {HFCs} in service delivery as well as resource constraints. The primary function of social accountability through {HFCs} appears to be co-production: the management of social relations around the health facility and the promotion of a minimum level of access and quality of services. Conclusions: Policymakers and {HFC} support programs should take into account the broad task description of {HFCs} and integrate social accountability approaches in existing quality of care programs. The study also underscores the need to clarify accountability arrangements and linkages with upward accountability approaches in the system. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction: the coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. South Sudan, a low-income and humanitarian response setting, reported its first case of {COVID}-19 on April 5, 2020. We describe the socio-demographic and epidemiologic characteristics of {COVID}-19 cases in this setting. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional descriptive analysis of data for 1,330 confirmed {COVID}-19 cases from the first 60 days of the outbreak. Results: among the 1,330 confirmed cases, the mean age was 37.1 years, 77\% were male, 17\% were symptomatic with 95\% categorized as mild, and the case fatality rate was 1.1\%. Only 24.7\% of cases were detected through alerts and sentinel site surveillance, with 95\% of the cases reported from the capital, Juba. Epidemic doubling time averaged 9.8 days (95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 7.7-13.4), with an attack rate of 11.5 per 100,000 population. Test positivity rate was 18.2\%, with test rate per 100,000 population of 53 and mean test turn-around time of 9 days. The case to contact ratio was 1: 2.2. Conclusion: this 2-month initial period of {COVID}-19 in South Sudan demonstrated mostly young adults and men affected, with most cases reported as asymptomatic. Systems´ limitations highlighted included a small proportion of cases detected through surveillance, low testing rates, low contact elicitation, and long collection to test turn-around times limiting the country´s ability to effectively respond to the outbreak. A multi-pronged response including greater access to testing, scale-up of surveillance, contact tracing and community engagement, among other interventions are needed to improve the {COVID}-19 response in this setting. © Joy Luba Lomole Waya et al.},

	abstract = {Despite emergency and essential surgery and anaesthesia care being recognised as a part of Universal Health Coverage, 5 billion people worldwide lack access to safe, timely and affordable surgery and anaesthesia care. In Tanzania, 19\% of all deaths and 17 \% of disability-adjusted life years are attributable to conditions amenable to surgery. It is recommended that countries develop and implement National Surgical, Obstetric and Anesthesia Plans ({NSOAPs}) to systematically improve quality and access to surgical, obstetric and anaesthesia ({SOA}) care across six domains of the health system including (1) service delivery, (2) infrastructure, including equipment and supplies, (3) workforce, (4) information management, (5) finance and (6) Governance. This paper describes the {NSOAP} development, recommendations and lessons learnt from undertaking {NSOAP} development in Tanzania. The {NSOAP} development driven by the Ministry of Health Community Development Gender Elderly and Children involved broad consultation with over 200 stakeholders from across government, professional associations, clinicians, ancillary staff, civil society and patient organisations. The {NSOAP} describes time-bound, costed strategic objectives, outputs, activities and targets to improve each domain of the {SOA} system. The final {NSOAP} is ambitious but attainable, reflects on-the-ground priorities, aligns with existing health policy and costs an additional 3\% of current healthcare expenditure. Tanzania is the third country to complete such a plan and the first to report on the {NSOAP} development in such detail. The {NSOAP} development in Tanzania provides a roadmap for other countries wishing to undertake a similar {NSOAP} development to strengthen their {SOA} system. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

	abstract = {Background: Globally, eye care provision is currently insufficient to meet the requirement for eye care services. Lack of access and awareness are key barriers to specialist services; in addition, specialist services are over-utilised by people with conditions that could be managed in the community or primary care. In combination, these lead to a large unmet need for eye health provision. We have developed a validated smartphone-based screening algorithm (Peek Community Screening App). The application (App) is part of the Peek Community Eye Health system (Peek {CEH}) that enables Community Volunteers ({CV}) to make referral decisions about patients with eye problems. It generates referrals, automated short messages service ({SMS}) notifications to patients or guardians and has a program dashboard for visualising service delivery. We hypothesise that a greater proportion of people with eye problems will be identified using the Peek {CEH} system and that there will be increased uptake of referrals, compared to those identified and referred using the current community screening approaches. Study design: A single masked, cluster randomised controlled trial design will be used. The unit of randomisation will be the 'community unit', defined as a dispensary or health centre with its catchment population. The community units will be allocated to receive either the intervention (Peek {CEH} system) or the current care (periodic health centre-based outreach clinics with onward referral for further treatment). In both arms, a triage clinic will be held at the link health facility four weeks from sensitisation, where attendance will be ascertained. During triage, participants will be assessed and treated and, if necessary, referred onwards to Kitale Eye Unit. Discussion: We aim to evaluate a M-health system (Peek {CEH}) geared towards reducing avoidable blindness through early identification and improved adherence to referral for those with eye problems and reducing demand at secondary care for conditions that can be managed effectively at primary care level. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Interventions aimed at reducing maternal mortality are increasingly complex. Understanding how complex interventions are delivered, to whom, and how they work is key in ensuring their rapid scale-up. We delivered a vital signs triage intervention into routine maternity care in eight low- and middle-income countries with the aim of reducing a composite outcome of morbidity and mortality. This was a pragmatic, hybrid effectiveness-implementation stepped-wedge randomised controlled trial. In this study, we present the results of the mixed-methods process evaluation. The aim was to describe implementation and local context and integrate results to determine whether differences in the effect of the intervention across sites could be explained. Methods: The duration and content of implementation, uptake of the intervention and its impact on clinical management were recorded. These were integrated with interviews (n = 36) and focus groups (n = 19) at 3 months and 6-9 months after implementation. In order to determine the effect of implementation on effectiveness, measures were ranked and averaged across implementation domains to create a composite implementation strength score and then correlated with the primary outcome. Results: Overall, 61.1\% (n = 2747) of health care providers were trained in the intervention (range 16.5\% to 89.2\%) over a mean of 10.8 days. Uptake and acceptability of the intervention was good. All clusters demonstrated improved availability of vital signs equipment. There was an increase in the proportion of women having their blood pressure measured in pregnancy following the intervention (79.2\% vs. 97.6\%; {OR} 1.30 (1.29-1.31)) and no significant change in referral rates (3.7\% vs. 4.4\% {OR} 0.89; (0.39-2.05)). Availability of resources and acceptable, effective referral systems influenced health care provider interaction with the intervention. There was no correlation between process measures within or between domains, or between the composite score and the primary outcome. Conclusions: This process evaluation has successfully described the quantity and quality of implementation. Variation in implementation and context did not explain differences in the effectiveness of the intervention on maternal mortality and morbidity. We suggest future trials should prioritise in-depth evaluation of local context and clinical pathways. Trial registration: Trial registration: {ISRCTN}41244132.

	abstract = {Many interventions were sought in the past to address the human health and aquatic life implications associated with poor Municipal Solid Waste Management ({MSWM}) practices. Majority of such interventions failed to recognise that such human health risks and threats to aquatic life are to a large extent moderated by unique characteristics of different urban and rural spaces where such waste is generated. They failed to employ multiple criteria-based evaluation models that are appropriate in depicting the complex and often interrelated criteria inherently associated with {MSWM}. This study used the Hierarchical Cluster Analysis ({HCA}) to evaluate several interdependent variables that define human health and aquatic life hazards associated with poor {MSWM} practices. Specifically, {HCA} was used to identify relative similarities among, and distances between a sample of 26 Ethiopian cities and towns in terms of {MSWM} health threats. Results indicated that threats to human health and aquatic life are surmountable for cities whose economies are relatively low and lacking capacity in terms of {SWM} infrastructure, acceptable institutional arrangements and better health-care facilities to deal with associated {SWM}-induced human health risks. Risk of flood waters owing to low altitude has also compounded the urban health conditions in such cities. Despite being better positioned, the analysis observed that some bigger cities still face problems in terms of effective land use planning policies, commitment towards implementing effective {SWM} programmes as well as the absence of water safety management plans. It concluded by proposing a number of targeted interventions seeking to improve the human health conditions of cities failing to cope with uncollected waste. © 2019. The Authors.},

	abstract = {Background Hypertension ({HTN}) is the single leading risk factor for human mortality worldwide, and more prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa than any other region [1]–although resources for {HTN} screening, treatment, and control are few. Most regional pilot studies to leverage {HIV} programs for {HTN} control have achieved blood pressure control in half of participants or fewer [2,3,4]. But this control gap may be due to inconsistent delivery of services, rather than ineffective underlying interventions. Methods We sought to evaluate the consistency of {HTN} program delivery within the {SEARCH} study ({NCT}01864603) among 95,000 adults in 32 rural communities in Uganda and Kenya from 2013–2016. To achieve this objective, we designed and performed a fidelity evaluation of the step-by-step process (cascade) of {HTN} care within {SEARCH}, calculating rates of {HTN} screening, linkage to care, and follow-up care. We evaluated {SEARCH}’s assessment of each participant’s {HTN} status against measured blood pressure and {HTN} history. Findings {SEARCH} completed blood pressure screens on 91\% of participants. {SEARCH} {HTN} screening was 91\% sensitive and over 99\% specific for {HTN} relative to measured blood pressure and patient history. 92\% of participants screened {HTN}+ received clinic appointments, and 42\% of persons with {HTN} linked to subsequent care. At follow-up, 82\% of {SEARCH} clinic participants received blood pressure checks; 75\% received medication appropriate for their blood pressure; 66\% remained in care; and 46\% had normal blood pressure at their most recent visit. Conclusion The {SEARCH} study’s consistency in delivering screening and treatment services for {HTN} was generally high, but {SEARCH} could improve effectiveness in linking patients to care and achieving {HTN} control. Its model for implementing population-scale {HTN} testing and care through an existing {HIV} test-and-treat program–and protocol for evaluating the intervention’s stepwise fidelity and care outcomes–may be adapted, strengthened, and scaled up for use across multiple resource-limited settings. © 2020 Heller et al.

	abstract = {Background Having hospitals located in urban areas where people, resources and wealth concentrate is efficient, but leaves long travel times for the rural and often poorer population and goes against the equity objective. We aimed to assess the current efficiency (mean travel time in the whole population) and equity (difference in travel time between the poorest and least poor deciles) of hospital care provision in four sub-Saharan African countries, and to compare them against their theoretical optima. Methods We overlaid the locations of 480, 115, 3787 and 256 hospitals in Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Tanzania, respectively, with high-resolution maps of travel time, population and wealth to estimate current efficiency and equity. To identify the potential optima, we simulated 7500 sets of hospitals locations based on various population and wealth weightings and percentage reallocations for each country. Results The average travel time ranged from 38 to 79 min across countries, and the respective optima were mildly shorter ({\textless}15\%). The observed equity gaps were wider than their optima. Compared with the best case scenarios, differences in the equity gaps varied from 7\% in Tanzania to 77\% in Nigeria. In Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania, narrower equity gaps without increasing average travel time were seen from simulations that held 75\%-90\% of hospitals at their current locations. Interpretations Current hospital distribution in the four sub-Saharan African countries could be considered efficient. Simultaneous gains in efficiency and equity do not necessarily require a fundamental redesign of the healthcare system.

	abstract = {Background: Knowing customers' level of satisfaction is relevant to improve and provide quality health care services. In the clinical laboratory, monitoring customers' satisfaction is an important indicator of the quality management system and required by international laboratory standards. However, in Ethiopia, there has not been baseline data about the satisfaction level of patients' with laboratory services at the national level. The aim of this national level survey was to assess patients' satisfaction level with laboratory services at public hospitals in Ethiopia. Methods: A national survey was conducted using an institutional based cross-sectional study design was employed from 01 to 30 November 2017. A total of 2399 patients were selected randomly from 60 public hospitals. Data was collected using structured questionnaire, entered in Epi Info and analyzed with {SPSS} software. Multiple logistic regression model was fitted to identify predictors of patients' satisfaction with laboratory services. A p-value of less than 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Result: Overall, 78.6\% of the patients were satisfied with the clinical laboratory services. Patients were dissatisfied with cleanness of latrine (47\%), long waiting time (30\%), clear and understandable advisory service during specimen collection (26\%), adequacy of waiting area (25\%), easy accessibility of laboratory (19\%) and latrine location (20\%), availability of requested service (18\%), unfair payment of service (17\%) and missing of result (12\%). The educational status (P = 0.032), and distance (P = 0.000) were significantly associated with client overall satisfaction level. Conclusion: Most laboratory patients' were satisfied with the service provided by public hospital laboratories in public hospitals in Ethiopia. However, patients' were dissatisfied with the accessibility of sites, adequacy of waiting area, cleanness of latrine, long {TAT}, communication, missing of results, availability of requested service and cost of service. Therefore, responsible bodies in each level should act on the identified gaps and improve the need of patients in each hospital laboratory. In addition, all hospital laboratories should conduct a satisfaction survey and meet the needs of laboratory patients. © The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

	abstract = {Background Facility-based delivery with skilled birth attendants in an enabling environment is recommended for life-saving and for improving maternal and newborn health outcomes. Inconsistent results exist regarding the protective effects of facility delivery on maternal and perinatal mortality in developing countries. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the association between place of delivery and maternal and perinatal mortality. A secondary objective was to examine the association between place of delivery and maternal complications during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and 48 hours postpartum. Methods This community-based prospective study recruited a cohort of 1719 women in their third trimester of pregnancy through a door-to-door survey in randomly selected wards in rural Geita Northwest Tanzania between September 2016 and December 2017. A total of 1385 eligible mother-infant pairs were followed to seven days post-delivery. Results Half of the women delivered at a health facility (52.23\%). A limited number of maternal deaths (n=7) were observed; 3 of these occurred at health facilities. No association was found between place of delivery and perinatal mortality (adjusted odds ratio, {aOR}=1.60, 95\% confidence interval, {CI}=0.65-3.80). The prevalence of maternal complications during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and 48 hours postpartum were 6.14\%, 8.74\%, and 12.56\%, respectively. A higher proportion of women who delivered at health facilities reported complications during labor and delivery (13.26\% vs 3.78\%) and 48 hours postnatally (14.78\% vs 10.14\%) than women who delivered at home. Conclusions Health facility delivery was not associated with reduced perinatal mortality. A higher proportion of women who delivered at health facilities reported complications during labour and delivery. Controlling for maternal complications attenuated the association between place of delivery and perinatal mortality. Many health facilities in rural Geita Tanzania remain ill-equipped to deal with unpredictable complications during childbirth. Improving staff training, access to essential drugs and equipment, and quality care could reduce perinatal mortality. © 2020, International Society of Global Health. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction: the Ebola virus disease ({EVD}) outbreak in Liberia from 2014-2015 setback the already fragile health system which was recovering from the effects of civil unrest. This led to significant decline in immunization coverage and key polio free certification indicators. The Liberia investment plan was developed to restore immunization service delivery and overall health system. Methods: we conducted a desk review to summarize performance of immunization coverage, polio eradication, measles control, new vaccines and technologies. Data sources include program reports, scientific and grey literature, District Health Information System ({DHIS}2), Integrated Diseases Surveillance and Response ({IDSR}) database, auto visual {AFP} detection and reporting ({AVADAR}) and {ONA} Servers. Data analysis was done using Microsoft excel spreadsheets, {ONA} software and Arc {GIS}. Results: there was a 36\% increase in national coverage for Penta 3 in 2017 compared to 2014 from {WUENIC} data. Penta 3 dropout rate reduced by 2.5 fold from 15.3\% in 2016 to 6.4\% in 2017; while {MCV}1 coverage improved by 23\% from 64\% in 2015 to 87\% in 2017. There was a rebound of non-polio {AFP} rate ({NPAFP}) rate from 1.2 in 2015 to 4.3 in 2017. Furthermore, there was a 2-fold increase in the number of {AFP} cases receiving 3 or more doses of {OPV} from 36\% in 2015 to 61\% in 2017. Conclusion: Liberia demonstrated strong rebound of immunization services following the largest and most devastating {EVD} outbreak in West Africa in 2014-2015. Immunization coverage improved and dropout rates reduced. However, there are still opportunities for improvement in the immunization program both at national and sub-national levels. © Adolphus Clarke et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Little is known about the role of private sector providers in providing and financing immunization. To fill this gap, the authors conducted a study in Benin, Malawi, and Georgia to estimate (1) the proportion of vaccinations taking place through the private sector; (2) private expenditures for vaccination; and (3) the extent of regulation. Methods: In each country, the authors surveyed a stratified random sample of 50 private providers (private for-profit and not-for-profit) using a standardized, pre-tested questionnaire administered by trained enumerators. In addition, the authors conducted 300 or more client exit interviews in each country. Results: The three countries had different models of private service provision of vaccination. In Malawi, 44\% of private facilities, predominantly faith-based organizations, administered an estimated 27\% of all vaccinations. In Benin, 18\% of private for-profit and not-for-profit facilities provided vaccinations, accounting for 8\% of total vaccinations. In Georgia, all sample facilities were privately managed, and conducted 100\% of private vaccinations. In all three countries, the Ministries of Health ({MoHs}) supplied vaccines and other support to private facilities. The study found that 6–76\% of clients paid nominal fees for vaccination cards and services, and a small percentage (2–26\%) chose to pay higher fees for vaccines not within their countries’ national schedules. The percentage of private expenditure on vaccination was less than 1\% of national health expenditures. The case studies revealed that service quality at private facilities was mixed, a finding that is similar to those of other studies on private sector vaccination. The three countries varied in how well the {MoHs} managed and supervised private sector services. Discussion/Conclusion: The private sector plays a growing role in lower-income countries and is expanding access to services. Governments’ ability to regulate and monitor immunization services and promote quality and affordable services in the private sector should be a priority. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background Health care quality has gained unprecedented attention within health systems. In line with the commitments of Government of Nepal’s ({GoN}) 2014 Health Policy and 2015 Constitution of Nepal, {GoN} is striving to achieve the goal of leaving no one behind with the provision of quality health services. This study aimed to assess health service readiness in hospitals and primary health care centers ({PHCCs}) of Nepal. Methods This analysis used data from the 2015 Nepal Health Facility Survey ({NHFS}), a nationally representative health facility survey that provide information on formal sector health facilities. The data for the analysis for this study was collected using the Inventory Questionnaire collected information on staffing, staff training, infrastructure, medicines, supplies, and services offered in health facilities assessed their service readiness within acceptable standards. The {WHO} Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) manual was used to guide the selection of indicators to measure general service readiness. Linear regression analysis was conducted to find the relationship between the facility readiness and the covariates, ie, facility level indicators. Results The average general service readiness score of study facilities in the study was 68.0. No remarkable difference was observed in the mean readiness index of hospitals (government and private). Health facilities in Terai region had low mean readiness score (65.9) compared to those in Mountain (68.1) and Hill (69.9), although no significant difference was detected in multivariate analysis. Province 4 had a significantly higher readiness score than province 1. There is a positive association between the external supervision within 4 months and system of collecting opinion in the facilities with the general service readiness in Nepal. Conclusions Health facilities had a poorer status on availability of essential medicine, standard precautions for Infection Prevention and diagnostic capacity than for availability of basic equipment and basic amenities. Facilities with external supervision in last 4 months, and facilities having a system of collecting client feedback had higher general service readiness scores. Hence, improving availability of basic inputs (essential medicine, infection prevention, diagnostic capacity) with high priority, and focusing on the external supervision, and client feedbacks are crucial to develop a universally accessible and effective health care for all Nepalese. © 2019, International Society of Global Health.

In Ifanadiana District, Madagascar, a collaboration between the Ministry of Public Health ({MoPH}) and {PIVOT}, a non-governmental organization ({NGO}), fosters Networks of Care ({NOC}) to support high-quality, patient-centered care. The district’s health system has three levels of care: community, health center, district hospital; a regional hospital is available for tertiary care services. We explore the {MoPH}/{PIVOT} collaboration through a case study which focuses on noteworthy elements of the collaboration across the four {NOC} domains: (I) agreement and enabling environment, ({II}) operational standards, ({III}) quality, efficiency, and responsibility, ({IV}) learning and adaptation. Under Domain I, we describe formal agreements between the {MoPH} and {PIVOT} and the process for engaging communities in creating effective {NOC}. Domain {II} discusses patient referral across levels of the health system and improvements to facility readiness and service availability. Under Domain {III} the collaboration prioritizes communication and supervision to support clinical quality, and social support for patients. Domain {IV} focuses on evaluation, research, and the use of data to modify programs to better meet community needs. The case study, organized by the domains of the {NOC} framework, demonstrates that a collaboration between the {MoPH} and an {NGO} can create effective {NOC} in a remote district with limited accessibility and advance the country’s agenda to achieve universal health coverage. © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background Unsafe abortion contributes to maternal morbidities, mortalities as well as social and financial costs to women, families, and the health system. This study aimed to examine the factors associated with unsafe abortion practices in Nepal. Methods Data were derived from the 2011 and 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys ({NDHS}). A total of 911 women aged 15–49 years who aborted five years prior to surveys were included in the analysis. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to determine factors associated with unsafe abortion. Results Unsafe abortion rate was seven per 1000 women aged 15–49 years. This research found that women living in the Mountains (adjusted Odds Ratio ({aOR}) 2.36; 95\% {CI} 1.21, 4.60), or those who were urban residents ({aOR} 2.11; 95\% {CI} 1.37, 3.24) were more likely to have unsafe abortion. The odds of unsafe abortion were higher amongst women of poor households ({aOR} 2.16; 95\% {CI} 1.18, 3.94); Dalit women ({aOR} 1.89; 95\% {CI} 1.02, 3.52), husband with no education background ({aOR} 2.12; 95\%{CI} 1.06, 4.22), or women who reported agriculture occupation ({aOR} 1.82; 95\% {CI} 1.16, 2.86) compared to their reference’s group. Regardless of knowledge on legal conditions of abortion, the probability of having unsafe abortion was significantly higher ({aOR} 5.13; 95\% {CI} 2.64, 9.98) amongst women who did not know the location of safe abortion sites. Finally, women who wanted to delay or space childbirth ({aOR} 2.71; 95\% {CI} 1.39, 5.28) or those who reported unwanted birth ({aOR} = 2.33; 95\% {CI} 1.19, 4.56) were at higher risk of unsafe abortion. Conclusion Going forward, increasing the availability of safe abortion facilities and strengthening family planning services can help reduce unsafe abortion in Nepal. These programmatic efforts should be targeted to women of poor households, disadvantaged ethnicities, and those who reside in mountainous region. © 2019 Khatri et al.

	abstract = {Background: Integrating family planning into postabortion and postpartum services can increase contraceptive use and decrease maternal and child death; however, little information exists on the monitoring and evaluation of such programs. This article draws on research completed by the {EngenderHealth}'s {AgirPF} project in three urban areas of Togo on the extent to which monitoring and evaluation systems of health services, which operated within the {AgirPF} project area in Togo, captured integrated family planning services. Methods: This mixed methods case study used 25 health facility assessments with health service record review in hospitals, large community clinics, a dispensary, and private clinics and 41 key informant interviews with health faculty, individuals working at reproductive health organizations, individuals involved in reproductive health policy and politics, health care workers, and health facility directors. Results: The study found the reporting system for health care was labor intensive and involved multiple steps for health care workers. The system lacked a standardized method to record family planning services as part of other health care at the patient level, yet the Ministry of Health required integrated family planning services to be reported on district and partner organization reporting forms. Key informants suggested improving the system by using computer-based monitoring, streamlining the reporting process to include all necessary information at the patient level, and standardizing what information is needed for the Ministry of Health and partner organizations. Conclusion: Future research should focus on assessing the best methods for recording integrated health services and task shifting of reporting. Recommendations for future policy and programming include consolidating data for reproductive health indicators, ensuring type of information needed is captured at all levels, and reducing provider workload for reporting. © 2019 Baker H et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Power imbalances are a key driver of avoidable, unfair and unjust differences in health. Devolution shifts the balance of power in health systems. Intersectionality approaches can provide a 'lens' for analysing how power relations contribute to complex and multiple forms of health advantage and disadvantage. These approaches have not to date been widely used to analyse health systems reforms. While the stated objectives of devolution often include improved equity, efficiency and community participation, past evidence demonstrates that that there is a need to create space and capacity for people to transform existing power relations these within specific contexts. Methods: We carried out a qualitative study between March 2015 and April 2016, involving 269 key informant and in-depth interviews from across the health system in ten counties, 14 focus group discussions with community members in two of these counties and photovoice participatory research with nine young people. We adopted an intersectionality lens to reveal how power relations intersect to produce vulnerabilities for specific groups in specific contexts, and to identify examples of the tacit knowledge about these vulnerabilities held by priority-setting stakeholders, in the wake of the introduction of devolution reforms in Kenya. Results: Our study identified a range of ways in which longstanding social forces and discriminations limit the power and agency individuals can exercise, but are mediated by their unique circumstances at a given point in their life. These are the social determinants of health, influencing an individual's exposure to risk of ill health from their living environment, their work, or their social context, including social norms relating to their gender, age, geographical residence or socio-economic status. While a range of policy measures have been introduced to encourage participation by typically 'unheard voices', devolution processes have yet to adequately challenge the social norms, and intersecting power relations which contribute to discrimination and marginalisation. Conclusions: If key actors in devolved decision-making structures are to ensure progress towards universal health coverage, there is need for intersectoral policy action to address social determinants, promote equity and identify ways to challenge and shift power imbalances in priority-setting processes. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: This study aimed to assess the quality of antenatal care ({ANC}) women received in Migori county, Kenya - including both service provision and experience dimensions - and to examine factors associated with each dimension. Methods: We used survey data collected in 2016 in Migori county from 1031 women aged 15-49 who attended {ANC} at least once in their most recent pregnancy. {ANC} quality service provision was measured by nine questions on receipt of recommended {ANC} services, and experience of care by 18 questions on information, communication, dignity, and facility environment. We summed the responses to the individual items to generate {ANC} service provision and experience of care scores. We used both linear and logistic regression to examine predictors. Results: The average service provision score was 10.9 ({SD} = 2.4) out of a total of 16. Most women received some recommended services once, but not at the frequency recommended by the Kenyan Ministry of Health. About 90\% had their blood pressure measured, and 78\% had a urine test, but only 58 and 14\% reported blood pressure monitoring and urine test, respectively, at every visit. Only 16\% received an ultrasound at any time during {ANC}. The average experience score is 27.3 ({SD} = 8.2) out of a total score of 42, with key gaps demonstrated in communication. About half of women were not educated on pregnancy complications. Also, about one-third did not often understand the purposes of tests and medicines received and did not feel able to ask questions to the health care provider. In multivariate analysis, women who were literate, employed, and who received all their {ANC} in a health center had higher experiences scores than women who were illiterate (coefficient = 1.52, {CI}:0.26,2.79), unemployed (coefficient = 2.73, {CI}:1.46,4.00), and received some {ANC} from a hospital (coefficient = 1.99, {CI}: 0.84, 3.14) respectively. The wealthiest women had two times higher odds of receiving an ultrasound than the poorest women ({OR} = 2.00, {CI}:1.20,3.33). Conclusion: Quality of {ANC} is suboptimal in both service provision and experience domains, with disparities by demographic and socioeconomic factors and facility type.

Methods: A pre–post study at Zanzibar's low-resource Mnazi Mmoja Hospital was conducted. All labouring women with {sHDP} were included at baseline (October 2014 to January 2015) and at 9–12 months after implementation of the ongoing intervention (October 2015 to January 2016). Background characteristics, clinical practice, and delivery outcomes were assessed by criterion-based case file reviews. Results: Overall, 188 of 2761 (6.8\%) women had {sHDP} at baseline, and 196 of 2398 (8.2\%) did so during the intervention months. The median time between last blood pressure recording and delivery decreased during the intervention compared with baseline (P=0.015). Among women with severe hypertension, antihypertensive treatment increased during the intervention compared with baseline (relative risk [{RR}] 1.37, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 1.14–1.66). Among the neonates delivered (birthweight ≥1000 g), stillbirths decreased ({RR} 0.56, 95\% {CI} 0.35–0.90) and Apgar scores of seven or more increased during the intervention compared with baseline ({RR} 1.17, 95\% {CI} 1.03–1.33). Conclusion: Although health system strengthening remains crucial, locally tailored clinical guidelines seemed to help work-overloaded birth attendants at a low-resource hospital to improve care for women with {sHDP}. {ClinicalTrials}.org: {NCT}02318420. © 2018 The Authors.

For each indicator, progress observed will be compared with that needed to meet the target, based on the indicator value in a baseline year, a later observed value, and the expected value in 2021 and 2030, respectively. Results: The Gap Analysis reveals achievements and serious delays for 21 health and health system indicators. Based on national data the reduction of the maternal mortality ratio will take an additional −8.2 years for the 2021 target and −12.5 years for the 2030 target. The Neonatal Mortality rate is experiencing similar delays of −7.9 years for 2021 and −12.9 for 2030 whereas the targets for the Under-5-Mortality rate can be achieved with small delays of −1.8 and −1.7 years. Conclusions: The Government of Liberia requires persistent efforts and international support to achieve its national targets and the Sustainable Development Goal 3 for health. © Copyright © 2019 Laaser, Broniatowski, Byepu and Bjegovic-Mikanovic.},

	abstract = {Background: There are numerous barriers leading to a high unmet need for family planning and contraceptives ({FP}/C). These include limited knowledge and information, poor access to quality services, structural inefficiencies in service provision and inadequately trained and supervised health professionals. Recently, social accountability programs have shown promising results in addressing barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health services. As a highly complex participatory process with multiple and interrelated components, steps and actors, studying social accountability poses methodological challenges. The Community and Provider driven Social Accountability Intervention ({CaPSAI}) Project study protocol was developed to measure the impact of a social accountability process on contraceptive uptake and use and to understand the mechanisms and contextual factors that influence and generate these effects (with emphasis on health services actors and community members). Methods: {CaPSAI} Project is implementing a social accountability intervention where service users and providers assess the quality of local {FP}/C services and jointly identify ways to improve the delivery and quality of such services. In the project, a quasi-experimental study utilizing an interrupted time series design with a control group is conducted in eight intervention and eight control facilities in each study country, which are Ghana and Tanzania. A cross-sectional survey of service users and health care providers is used to measure social accountability outcomes, and a cohort of women who are new users of {FP}/C is followed up after the completion of the intervention to measure contraceptive use and continuation. The process evaluation utilizes a range of methods and data sources to enable a fuller description of how the findings were produced. Conclusion: This complex study design could provide researchers and implementers with the means to better measure and understand the mechanisms and contextual factors that influence social accountability processes in reproductive health, adding important findings to the evidence base. © 2020 Steyn {PS} et al.},

	abstract = {Introduction Information, counseling, availability of contraceptives, and their adoption by post-abortion care ({PAC}) patients are central to the quality of {PAC} in healthcare facilities. Effective contraceptive adoption by these patients reduces the risks of unintended pregnancy and repeat abortion. Methods This study uses data from the Incidence and Magnitude of Unsafe Abortion Study of 2012 to assess the level and determinants of highly effective contraception among patients treated with complications from an unsafe abortion in healthcare facilities in Kenya. Highly effective contraception was defined as any method adopted by a {PAC} patient that reduces pregnancy rate by over 99\%. Results Generally, contraceptive counseling was high among all {PAC} patients (90\%). However, only 54\% of them received a modern family planning method—45\% a short-acting method and 9\% a long-acting and permanent method. Adoption of highly effective contraception was determined by patient’s previous exposure to unintended pregnancies, induced abortion and modern family planning ({FP}). Facility level factors associated with the uptake of highly effective contraceptives included: facility ownership, availability of evacuation procedure room, whether the facility had a specialized obstetric-gynecologist, a facility that also had maternity services and the number of {FP} methods available for {PAC} patients. Discussion and conclusion For better adoption of highly effective {FP}, counseling of {PAC} patients requires an understanding of the patient’s past experience with contraception and their future fertility intentions and desires in order to meet their reproductive needs more specifically. Family planning integration with {PAC} can increase contraceptive uptake and improve the reproductive health of post-abortion care patients. © 2019 Mutua et al.

This study aimed to assess the trends and changes in socioeconomic inequalities in the use of {ANC} services by women aged 15 to 49 years in Vietnam from 2006 to 2014. We used data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey conducted in 2006, 2011, and 2014. The percentage of women who received {ANC} services increased significantly from 26.5\% in 2006 to 42.7\% in 2011 and reached 56.6\% in 2014. We found a decreasing trend in the concentration indices of the use of {ANC} services from 0.36 in 2006 to 0.19 in 2014. The common factors significantly associated with the higher percentage of the use of {ANC} services in 2006, 2011, and 2014 were women belonging to the Kinh and Hoa ethnic groups and belonging to wealthier groups. Our study showed a reduction in socioeconomic inequality in the use of {ANC} services between 2004 and 2014.

	abstract = {Introduction Aiming for universal health coverage ({UHC}) as a country-level goal requires that progress is measured and tracked over time. However, few national and subnational studies monitor {UHC} in low-income countries and there is none for Ethiopia. This study aimed to estimate the 2015 national and subnational {UHC} service coverage status for Ethiopia. Methods The {UHC} service coverage index was constructed from the geometric means of component indicators: first, within each of four major categories and then across all components to obtain the final summary index. Also, we estimated the subnational level {UHC} service coverage. We used a variety of surveys data and routinely collected administrative data. Results Nationally, the overall Ethiopian {UHC} service coverage for the year 2015 was 34.3\%, ranging from 52.2\% in the Addis Ababa city administration to 10\% in the Afar region. The coverage for non-communicable diseases, reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health and infectious diseases were 35\%, 37.5\% and 52.8\%, respectively. The national {UHC} service capacity and access coverage was only 20\% with large variations across regions, ranging from 3.7\% in the Somali region to 41.1\% in the Harari region. Conclusion The 2015 overall {UHC} service coverage for Ethiopia was low compared with most of the other countries in the region. Also, there was a substantial variation among regions. Therefore, Ethiopia should rapidly scale up promotive, preventive and curative health services through increasing investment in primary healthcare if Ethiopia aims to reach the {UHC} service coverage goals. Also, policymakers at the regional and federal levels should take corrective measures to narrow the gap across regions, such as redistribution of the health workforce, increase resources allocated to health and provide focused technical and financial support to low-performing regions. © 2019 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background The study describes the conditions of public health sector in the Island Municipality of Jomalig, Quezon Province in Luzon, Philippines. Located at the far north-eastern side of the Quezon Province, Jomalig Island can be reached through a motor boat at around 4-5 hours (or more depending on the sea condition). Given the geographical disadvantage, challenges in economic and social services in the island are apparent. That includes deficiencies in basic public utility services such as water and electricity. The paper showcases a needs assessment on public health facilities and services in a far-flung municipality in the Philippines. This study examines the challenges in public health aspirations in a location considered to be a geographically isolated and disadvantaged area ({GIDA}). Methods The study made use of key informant interviews ({KIIs}) among health professionals and village health workers in the island. Aside from the {KIIs}, the study included the World Health Organization’s ({WHO}) tracer checklist on general readiness. The checklist was administered but in interview style. The participants were the public health staff in the island. The researcher was able to interview the health professionals (nurses and a midwife) manning the main public health facility in the island municipality while in the case of the other villages, health volunteers or the Barangay Health Worker ({BHWs}) were interviewed. Results There are deficiencies in facilities, offered services and health staff. Deficiencies are seen too based on the domains under the {WHO} Tracer Checklist. Mortality and morbidity rates were not at alarming rate though reports of hypertension and diarrhea are common. The relatively “complete” health services are only available at the island’s main health center yet unfortunately, some people who seek treatment and health care could not visit due to distance and the accompanying expenditures. Other factors affecting health status of the population include the reliance to “faith healers” (quack doctors or Albularyos) and the delay of parental reports of their health condition and the condition of their children, both of which result to the “escalation” of illness. Among others, challenges and aspirations of the island’s public health sector include electric supply, better budgetary allocation for their facilities, and equipment and additional training for the barangay (village) health workers. Conclusions Enduring the underfinanced and undermanned health facilities, the island’s population also suffers the consequences on overall health owing to limited movements and communication due to the geographical characteristics of the municipality. Emergency boats per village, health education campaign that focuses on eliminating open defecation and reliance on quack doctors, stand-by generators for the health centers, and radio communication system are strongly recommended to mitigate the negative impacts of living within {GIDA} communities. © 2019, International Society of Global Health.

	abstract = {Introduction Routine health information systems are critical for monitoring service delivery. District Heath Information System, version 2 ({DHIS}2) is an open source software platform used in more than 60 countries, on which global initiatives increasingly rely for such monitoring. We used facility-reported data in {DHIS}2 for Gombe State, north-eastern Nigeria, to present a case study of data quality to monitor priority maternal and neonatal health indicators. Methods For all health facilities in {DHIS}2 offering antenatal and postnatal care services (n = 497) and labor and delivery services (n = 486), we assessed the quality of data for July 2016-June 2017 according to the World Health Organization data quality review guidance. Using data from {DHIS}2 as well as external facility-level and population-level household surveys, we reviewed three data quality dimensions-completeness and timeliness, internal consistency, and external consistency-and considered the opportunities for improvement. Results Of 14 priority maternal and neonatal health indicators that could be tracked through facility-based data, 12 were included in Gombe's {DHIS}2. During July 2016-June 2017, facility-reported data in {DHIS}2 were incomplete at least 40\% of the time, under-reported 10\%-60\% of the events documented in facility registers, and showed inconsistencies over time, between related indicators, and with an external data source. The best quality data elements were those that aligned with Gombe's health program priorities, particularly older health programs, and those that reflected contact indicators rather than indicators related to the provision of commodities or content of care. Conclusion This case study from Gombe State, Nigeria, demonstrates the high potential for effective monitoring of maternal and neonatal health using {DHIS}2. However, coordinated action at multiple levels of the health system is needed to maximize reporting of existing data; rationalize data flow; routinize data quality review, feedback, and supervision; and ensure ongoing maintenance of {DHIS}2.

	abstract = {Introduction Voluntary medical male circumcision ({VMMC}) provides significant reductions in the risk of female-to-male {HIV} transmission. Since 2007, {VMMC} has been a key component of the United States President’s Emergency Plan for {AIDS} Relief’s ({PEPFAR}) strategy to mitigate the {HIV} epidemic in countries with high {HIV} prevalence and low circumcision rates. To ensure intended effects, {PEPFAR} sets ambitious annual circumcision targets and provides funding to implementation partners to deliver local {VMMC} services. In Kenya to date, 1.9 million males have been circumcised; in 2017, 60\% of circumcisions were among 10-14-year-olds. We conducted a qualitative field study to learn more about {VMMC} program implementation in Kenya. Methods and results The study setting was a region in Kenya with high {HIV} prevalence and low male circumcision rates. From March 2017 through April 2018, we carried out in-depth interviews with 29 {VMMC} stakeholders, including “mobilizers”, {HIV} counselors, clinical providers, schoolteachers, and policy professionals. Additionally, we undertook observation sessions at 14 {VMMC} clinics while services were provided and observed mobilization activities at 13 community venues including, two schools, four public marketplaces, two fishing villages, and five inland villages. Analysis of interview transcripts and observation field notes revealed multiple unintended consequences linked to the pursuit of targets. Ebbs and flows in the availability of school-age youths together with the drive to meet targets may result in increased burdens on clinics, long waits for care, potentially misleading mobilization practices, and deviations from the standard of care. Conclusion Our findings indicate shortcomings in the quality of procedures in {VMMC} programs in a low-resource setting, and more importantly, that the pursuit of ambitious public health targets may lead to compromised service delivery and protocol adherence. There is a need to develop improved or alternative systems to balance the goal of increasing service uptake with the responsible conduct of {VMMC}. © 2019 Gilbertson et al.

	abstract = {Rethinking Ownership of Development in Africa demonstrates how instead of empowering the communities they work with, the jargon of development ownership often actually serves to perpetuate the centrality of multilateral organizations and international donors in African development, awarding a fairly minimal role to local partners. In the context of today’s development scheme for Africa, ownership is often considered to be the panacea for all of the aid-dependent continent’s development woes. Reinforced through the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ({OECD})‘s Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action, ownership is now the preeminent procedure for achieving aid effectiveness and a range of development outcomes. Throughout this book, the author illustrates how the ownership paradigm dictates who can produce development knowledge and who is responsible for carrying it out, with a specific focus on the health sectors in Burkina Faso and Kenya. Under this paradigm, despite the ownership narrative, national stakeholders in both countries are not producers of development knowledge; they are merely responsible for its implementation. This book challenges the preponderance of conventional international development policies that call for more ownership from African stakeholders without questioning the implications of donor demands and historical legacies of colonialism in Africa. Ultimately, the findings from this book make an important contribution to critical development debates that question international development as an enterprise capable of empowering developing nations. This lively and engaging book challenges readers to think differently about the ownership, and as such will be of interest to researchers of development studies and African studies, as well as for development practitioners within Africa. © 2020 T.

The outer loading value measured the sub-variable validity value of its latent variable, where the outer loading is valid if the value is {\textgreater}0.4. Based on the research results, nine indicators were invalid (outer loading value = 0.4), and the indicator must be removed from the model. Evaluation of inner models was used to test the research hypotheses. The research hypothesis can be accepted if the value of T count {\textgreater}T table. The health services, patient factors, family factors and empowerment have a significant influence between some of these factors on {HQRL} (T {\textgreater}1.96).

Design: Secondary analysis of the cross-sectional Mozambican Household Budget Survey ({HBS}). Setting: Nationally-representative sample of households in Mozambique. Participants: 11 480 households (58 118 individuals) interviewed during {HBS} 2014/15. Intervention: None. Main Outcome Measures: Equity, utilization of healthcare, access to quality care and direct payments. Results: About 12.2\% of women and 10.1\% of men of the survey report a perceive health need. About 72.1\% of women and 72.9\% men use healthcare. Population in a disadvantaged position living in rural areas have less probabilities of using healthcare for equal health compared to the individuals of a wealthier position and living in urban settings. With regard to quality care, 47.7\% women and 46.8\% men do not report quality problems. No differences for women's wealth. Men in a disadvantaged position report less chances of accessing quality care compared to men of advantaged position. Also, women and men living in rural areas have less probabilities of accessing quality care. Finally, the majority of people who access healthcare paid 1 Mt during their visit. Conclusions: This study tackles a fundamental policy concern for health systems of Sub-Saharan Africa and points to areas that urge action to address the existent of socioeconomic and geographical inequalities in the access to and quality of care for women and men, including the strengthening of health facilities in rural and deprived areas to ensure that access to adequate care of acceptable quality is distributed according to need. © 2018 The Author(s) 2019.

Methods: We utilised cross-sectional population-based Demographic Health Surveys ({DHSs}) data collected from mothers aged 18-49 years in 2004/05, 2010, and 2015/16 in Malawi. The outcome measure was caesarian birth within 5 years preceding the surveys. The main independent variable was maternal Body Mass Index ({BMI}) measured as weight in kilograms by height in meters squared (kg/m                             2                             ) and categorized according to the World Health Organization ({WHO}) guidelines. Generalized estimating equations ({GEE}) regression models were constructed to analyze total samples of 6795, 4474 and 4363 in 2004/05, 2010 and 2015/16 respectively. Results: There was an observed increase in the trend of caesarean births as well as maternal overweight and obesity from 2004 to 2015. The results of the multivariate analyses showed that maternal overweight (adjusted odds ratio [{aOR}] = 1.35; 95\% Confidence Interval [{CI}] 1.01-1.83) in 2015/16 and ({aOR} = 1.36; 95\% {CI}: 1.10-1.65) from 2004 to 2015 were risk factors for caesarean births in Malawi. In addition, being obese ({aOR} = 2.15; 95\% {CI}: 1.12-4.11) in 2004/05, ({aOR} = 1.66; 95\% {CI}: 1.08-2.55) in 2010, ({aOR} = 2.18; 95\% {CI}: 1.48-3.21) in 2015/16, and ({aOR} = 2.16; 95\% {CI}: 1.65-2.84) from 2004 to 2015) increased the risk of caesarean births. In addition, women who had one parity, and lived in the northern region were significantly more likely to have undergone caesarean birth. Conclusions: In order to reduce non-elective cesarean birth in Malawi, specific public health programs should be focus on reducing overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age. More focus attention may be given to women with one parity, particularly in the urban and the northern region of Malawi.                          © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: World Health Organization revised the global guidelines for management of possible serious bacterial infection ({PSBI}) in young infants to recommend the use of simplified antibiotic therapy in settings where access to hospital care is not possible. The Bangladesh Ministry of Health and Family Welfare ({MoHFW}), Government of Bangladesh ({GOB}) adopted these guidelines, allowing treatment at first-level facilities. During the first year of implementation, the Projahnmo Study Group and {USAID}/{MaMoni} Health Systems Strengthening ({HSS}) Project supported the {MoHFW} to operationalize the new guidelines and conducted an implementation research study in selected districts to assess challenges and identify solutions to facilitate scale-up across the country. Implementation support: Projahnmo and {MaMoni} {HSS} teams supported implementation in three areas: building capacity, strengthening service delivery, and mobilizing communities. Capacity building focused on training paramedics to conduct outpatient management of {PSBI} cases and developing monitoring and supervision systems. The teams also filled gaps in government supply of essential drugs, equipment, and logistics. Community mobilization strategies to promote care-seeking and referrals to facilities varied across districts; in one district community, health workers made home visits while in another district, the promotion was carried out through community volunteers, village doctors, and through existing community structures. Methods: We followed a plan-do-study-Act ({PDSA}) cycle to identify and address implementation challenges. Three cycles-1 every 4 months-were conducted. We collected data utilizing quantitative and qualitative methods in both the community and facilities. The total sample size for this study was 13,590. Discussion: This article provides implementation research design details for program managers intending to implement new guidelines on management of young infant infections. Results of this research will be reported in the forthcoming papers. Preliminary findings indicate that the management of {PSBI} cases at the {UH}\&{FWCs} is feasible. However, {MoHFW}, {GOB} needs to address the implementation challenges before scale-up of this policy to the national level. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background In sub-Saharan Africa ({SSA}), over 200 000 women (66\% of global figures) die annually due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Many of these deaths are preventable, especially if women have access to timely emergency obstetric care ({EmOC}). With poor roads and difficult topography in the region, access can be impeded. Based on United Nations {EmOC} assessment guidelines, minimum acceptable levels for geographical distribution of {EmOC} facilities have been defined ({EmOC} Indicator 2). We aimed to critically assess studies published in the peer-review literature that assessed {EmOC} geographical distribution and accessibility in {SSA}. Methods Two reviewers systematically searched multiple databases for articles published between January 2009 and June 2018. Both screened and selected studies based on the set inclusion criteria. Following quality assessments, data on study characteristics, process of data collection and analysis and findings reported were extracted. Extracted data were synthesised and presented in tables and charts. Narrative synthesis was used to summarise reported findings. Results 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, with varying assessed quality: high (7 studies), medium (4 studies) and low (4 studies). 8 studies were conducted at a national level while 7 were sub-national. 8 studies focused on assessing Indicator 2, while the others assessed multiple {EmOC} indicators. Only about half of the studies presented details of analysis for assessing geographical distribution, provided a map and interpreted their findings. Similarly, half of the studies used geographic information systems ({GIS}) for analyses. Of these, {GIS} was used to map {EmOC} facilities or relate facility numbers to 500 000 population (3), estimate straight-line distances between facilities and residences of women (2) and model travel scenarios (3). {EmOC} facilities in {SSA} are concentrated in capitals, central and urban areas and at least a third of women in the region cannot reach their nearest {EmOC} facility within the recommended two-hour time-frame. Conclusions There is a limited number of studies that have assessed {EmOC} geographical distribution in {SSA}. When available, completeness and quality of analysis are questionable. Comprehensive assessments need to maximise recent advancements in mobile and {GIS} open-source technology to provide more realistic representation of {EmOC} access for service planners and policy- makers. © 2019 The Author(s) {JoGH}.},

	abstract = {Introduction Although the number of women who deliver with a skilled birth attendant in India has almost doubled between 2006 and 2016, the country still has the second highest number of maternal deaths and the highest number of neonatal deaths globally. This study examines the impact of a nurse mentoring programme intended to improve the quality of intrapartum care at primary healthcare centre ({PHC}) facilities in Bihar, India. Method We conducted an evaluation study in 319 public {PHCs} in Bihar, where nurses participated in a mentoring programme. Using a quasi-experimental trial design, we compared the intrapartum quality of care between the mentored (n=179) and non-mentored {PHCs} (n=80). Based on direct observation of 847 women, we examined percent differences in 39 labour, delivery and postpartum care-related recommended tasks on five domains: vital sign and labour progress monitoring after admission, second and third stages of labour management, postpartum counselling, infection prevention and essential newborn care practices. Results A significantly higher proportion of women at mentored {PHCs} received the recommended clinical care, compared with women at non-mentored {PHCs}. The overall total score of quality of care, expressed in percent of tasks performed, was 30.2\% (95\% {CI}: 28.3 to 32.2) in the control {PHCs}, suggesting that less than one-third of the expected tasks during labour and delivery were performed by nurses in these facilities; the score was 44.2\% (95\% {CI}: 42.1 to 46.4) among the facilities where the nurses were trained within last 3 months. The task completion score was slightly attenuated when observed 1 year after mentoring (score 39.1\% [37.7-40.5]). Conclusion Mentoring improved intrapartum care by nurses at {PHCs} in Bihar. However, less than half of the recommended normal delivery intrapartum tasks were completed by the nurse providers. This suggests the need for further improvement in the provision of quality of intrapartum care when risks to maternal and perinatal mortality are highest. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

	doi = {10.1186/s12913-018-3791-5},
	abstract = {Background: Severe malarial anaemia is one of the leading causes of paediatric hospital admissions in Malawi. Post-discharge malaria chemoprevention ({PMC}) is the intermittent administration of full treatment courses of antimalarial to children recovering from severe anaemia and findings suggest that this intervention significantly reduces readmissions and deaths in these children. Community delivery of health interventions utilizing community health workers ({CHWs}) has been successful in some programmes and not very positive in others. In Malawi, there is an on-going cluster randomised trial that aims to find the optimum strategy for delivery of dihydroartemesinin-piperaquine ({DHP}) for {PMC} in children with severe anaemia. Our qualitative study aimed to explore the feasibility of utilizing {CHWs} also known as health surveillance assistants ({HSAs}) to remind caregivers to administer {PMC} medication in the existing Malawian health system. Methods: Between December 2016 and March 2018, 20 individual in-depth-interviews ({IDIs}) and 2 focus group discussions ({FGDs}) were conducted with 39 {HSAs} who had the responsibility of conducting home visits to remind caregivers of children who were prescribed {PMC} medication in the trial. All interviews were conducted in the local language, transcribed verbatim, and translated into English. The transcripts were uploaded to {NVIVO} 11 and analysed using the thematic framework analysis method. Results: Although intrinsic motivation was reportedly high, adherence to the required number of home visits was very poor with only 10 {HSAs} reporting full adherence. Positive factors for adherence were the knowledge and perception of the effectiveness of {PMC} and the recognition from the community as well as health system. Poor training, lack of supervision, high workload, as well as technical and structural difficulties; were reported barriers to adherence by the {HSAs}. Conclusions: Post-discharge malaria chemoprevention with {DHP} is perceived as a positive approach to manage children recovering from severe anaemia by {HSAs} in Malawi. However, adherence to home visit reminders was very poor and the involvement of {HSAs} in a scale up of this intervention may pose a challenge in the existing Malawian health system.

	abstract = {Background: Maternal and neonatal mortality remain high in southern Tanzania despite an increasing number of births occurring in health facilities. In search for reasons for the persistently high mortality rates, we explored illness recognition, decision-making and care-seeking for cases of maternal and neonatal illness and death. Methods: We conducted 48 in-depth interviews (16 participants who experienced maternal illnesses, 16 mothers whose newborns experienced illness, eight mothers whose newborns died, and eight family members of a household with a maternal death), and five focus group discussions with community leaders in two districts of Mtwara region. Thematic analysis was used for interpretation of findings. Results: Our data indicated relatively timely illness recognition and decision-making for maternal complications. In contrast, families reported difficulties interpreting newborn illnesses. Decisions on care-seeking involved both the mother and her partner or other family members. Delays in care-seeking were therefore also reported in absence of the husband, or at night. Primary-level facilities were first consulted. Most respondents had to consult more than one facility and described difficulties accessing and receiving appropriate care. Definitive treatment for maternal and newborn complications was largely only available in hospitals. Conclusions: Delays in reaching a facility that can provide appropriate care is influenced by multiple referrals from one facility to another. Referral and care-seeking advice should include direct care-seeking at hospitals in case of severe complications and primary facilities should facilitate prompt referral. © 2019 The Author(s).},

The {UN} and {WHO} encourage countries to make health facility location data open, to encourage use and improvement. We provide a summary of open access health facility location data in Africa using re-useable code. We aim to support data analysts developing software tools to address {COVID}-19 response in individual countries. In Africa there are currently three main sources of such data; 1) direct from national ministries of health, 2) a database for sub-Saharan Africa collated and published by a team from {KEMRI}-Wellcome Trust Research Programme and now hosted by {WHO}, and 3) The Global Healthsites Mapping Project in collaboration with {OpenStreetMap}. Methods: We searched for and documented official national facility location data that were openly available. We developed re-useable open-source R code to summarise and visualise facility location data by country from the three sources. This re-useable code is used to provide a web user interface allowing data exploration through maps and plots of facility type. Results: Out of 53 African countries, seven provide an official open facility list that can be downloaded and analysed reproducibly. Considering all three sources, there are over 185,000 health facility locations available for Africa. However, there are differences and overlaps between sources and a lack of data on capacities and service provision. Conclusions: We suggest that these summaries and tools will encourage greater use of existing health facility location data, incentivise further improvements in the provision of those data by national suppliers, and encourage collaboration within wider data communities. The tools are a part of the afrimapr project, actively developing R building blocks to facilitate the use of health data in Africa. © 2020 South A et al.},

	abstract = {Despite numerous international and national efforts, only 12 countries in the World Health Organization's African Region met the Millennium Development Goal \#4 ({MDG}\#4) to reduce under-five mortality by two-thirds by 2015. Given the variability across sub-Saharan Africa, a four-country study was undertaken to examine barriers and facilitators of child survival prior to 2015. Liberia and Zambia were chosen to represent countries making substantial progress towards {MDG}\#4, while Kenya and Zimbabwe represented countries making less progress. Our individual case studies suggested that strong health governance and leadership ({HGL}) was a significant driver of the greater success in Liberia and Zambia compared with Kenya and Zimbabwe. To elucidate specific components of national {HGL} that may have substantially influenced the pace of reductions in child mortality, we conducted a cross-country analysis of national policies and strategies pertaining to maternal, neonatal and child health ({MNCH}) and qualitative interviews with individuals working in {MNCH} in each of the four study countries. The three aspects of {HGL} identified in this study which most consistently contributed to the different progress towards {MDG}\#4 among the four study countries were (1) establishing child survival as a top national priority backed by a comprehensive policy and strategy framework and sufficient human, financial and material resources; (2) bringing together donors, strategic partners, health and non-health stakeholders and beneficiaries to collaborate in strategic planning, decision-making, resource-allocation and coordination of services; and (3) maintaining accountability through a 'monitor-review-act' approach to improve {MNCH}. Although child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa remains high, this comparative study suggests key health leadership and governance factors that can facilitate reduction of child mortality and may prove useful in tackling current Sustainable Development Goals. © The Author(s) 2019.

	abstract = {Background Achieving fair access to healthcare and improving population health are crucial in all settings. Properly staffed and fairly distributed primary health care ({PHC}) facilities are prerequisites to ensure accessible healthcare services. Nevertheless, availability and accessibility issues are common public health concerns, especially in under-resourced countries including Ethiopia. Measuring inequalities in accessibility of healthcare resources guide policy decisions to improve {PHC} services and ultimately achieving universal health coverage ({UHC}). Purpose To assess availability and measure magnitude and trend of inequalities in accessibility of health centre-based {PHC} resources in Ethiopia during 2015 to 2017. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional population-based analysis of district-level data collected from 16                             th                              December 2017 until 24                             th                              May 2018. Afar, Dire-Dawa, and Tigray regions were purposefully included in the study to represent the four pastoralist/semi-pastoralist, three urban and four agrarian regions in Ethiopia, respectively. We used ratios, different inequality indices and Gini decomposition techniques to characterise the inequalities. Results In 2017, median of health centres ({HCs}) per 15,000 inhabitants and their Gini indices ({GIs}) for Afar, Dire-Dawa, and Tigray were 0.781, 0.566, 0.591 vs. 0.237, 0.280, 0.216 respectively. Median overall skilled health workers ({SHWs}) per 10,000 inhabitants were 5.250, 7.539, and 6.246, respectively. These accounted for 11.80\%, 16.94\% and 14.04\% of the {WHO} target of 44.5 to achieve {SDGs}. The corresponding {GIs} for the regions were 0.347, 0.186 and 0.175. Despite a higher overall {SHWs} inequality in the urban districts of Tigray ({GI} = 0.301), only Tigray showed significant inequality reductions in {GHE} (p {\textless} 0.001) and in all categories of {SHWs} (p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions Our analysis provided a clear picture of availability and inequalities in {PHC} resources across three regions in Ethiopia. Identifying contributing factors to low densities and high inequalities of {SHWs} may help improve {PHC} services nationwide, along with pathway towards {UHC}.                          © 2019 Woldemichael et al.

	abstract = {Background: In 2009, Gavi, the World Bank, and donors launched the pneumococcal Advance Market Commitment, which helped countries access more affordable pneumococcal vaccines. As many low-income countries begin to reach the threshold at which countries transition from Gavi support to self-financing (3-year average gross national income per capita of {US}\$1580), they will need to consider whether to continue pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}) use at full cost or to discontinue {PCV} in their childhood immunisation programmes. Using Kenya as a case study, we assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness of continuing {PCV} use. Methods: In this modelling and cost-effectiveness study, we fitted a dynamic compartmental model of pneumococcal carriage to annual carriage prevalence surveys and invasive pneumococcal disease ({IPD}) incidence in Kilifi, Kenya. We predicted disease incidence and related mortality for either continuing {PCV} use beyond 2022, the start of Kenya's transition from Gavi support, or its discontinuation. We calculated the costs per disability-adjusted life-year ({DALY}) averted and associated 95\% prediction intervals ({PI}). Findings: We predicted that if {PCV} use is discontinued in Kenya in 2022, overall {IPD} incidence will increase from 8·5 per 100 000 in 2022, to 16·2 per 100 000 per year in 2032. Continuing vaccination would prevent 14 329 (95\% {PI} 6130–25 256) deaths and 101 513 (4386–196 674) disease cases during that time. Continuing {PCV} after 2022 will require an estimated additional {US}\$15·8 million annually compared with discontinuing vaccination. We predicted that the incremental cost per {DALY} averted of continuing {PCV} would be \$153 (95\% {PI} 70–411) in 2032. Interpretation: Continuing {PCV} use is essential to sustain its health gains. Based on the Kenyan {GDP} per capita of \$1445, and in comparison to other vaccines, continued {PCV} use at full costs is cost-effective (on the basis of the assumption that any reduction in disease will translate to a reduction in mortality). Although affordability is likely to be a concern, our findings support an expansion of the vaccine budget in Kenya. Funding: Wellcome Trust and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. © 2019 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: Globally, over 37.9 million people arse living with {HIV} in 2018 and {subSaharan} Africa carries 71\% of the global {HIV} epidemics. In Ethiopia, there were an estimated 613,000 {HIV} cases in 2017. This study aimed to assess the trend of {HIV} incidence in the Amhara Region, Ethiopia. Methods: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted using routine {HIV} data from 2015 to 2018. We extracted {HIV} records from the Amhara Regional Health Bureau database. Data confidentiality was secured through data anonymity. Data were entered, cleaned and analyzed by {IBM} {SPSS} version 22 (Armonk, {NY}, {USA}). Various descriptive statistics such as counts, proportions and trends were computed to see the magnitude of {HIV} in the study area. Results: A total of 57,293 new {HIV} cases were reported from 2015 to 2018 and 33,720 (59\%) were females. The majority, 40,054 (70\%), of {HIV} cases were among people in 25−49 years. The overall incidence rate of {HIV} from 2015 to 2018 was 6.9 per 1000 population. The annual {HIV} incidence rates were 7.3. 6.3, 7.4 and 6.63 per 1000 population in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The incidence rate per 1000 population was high in Dessie town (5.74), Bahir Dar city (4.27) and Gondar town (3.00). About 49,564 (86.5\%) of {HIV} cases have started {ART} and 33\% of them had {TB} infection where 54\% of them were females. Only 14869 (30\%) people on {ART} had normal nutritional status. Conclusion: {HIV} remains a public health concern in the Amhara Region and the burden varied by place, time, gender and age groups. Improving awareness creation and community mobilization, managing {TB} infection and undernutrition problems, and making {HIV} screening services available in all healthcare facilities are crucial to decrease {HIV} infection. Special attention is also required to avoid risk factors that increased {HIV} incidence among females. © 2020 Worku et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Hypertension is a common vascular disease and the main risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Since the incidence of hypertension is rising in Ethiopia, one may expect that the household’s cost of healthcare services related to the disease will increase in the near future. Yet the cost associated with the disease is not known. We aimed to estimate the total cost of hypertension illness and identify associated factors among patients attending hospitals in Southwest Shewa zone, Oromia regional state, Ethiopia. Patients and Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed to conduct the study from 13 August to 2 September 2018. All hypertensive patients aged 18 years and older who were on follow-up were eligible for this study. The total cost of hypertension illness was estimated by summing the direct and indirect costs. Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with hypertension costs of illnesses. Results: A total of 349 patients participated in the study. The mean monthly total cost of hypertension illness was {US}\$ 22.3 (95\% {CI}, 21.3-23.3). Direct and indirect costs constitute 51\% and 49\% of the total cost, respectively. The mean direct cost of hypertension illness per patient per month was {US}\$ 11.39 (95\% {CI}, 10.6-12.1). Out of these, drugs comprised higher cost (31\%), followed by food (25\%). The mean indirect cost per patient per month was {US}\$ 10.89 (95\% {CI}, 10.4-11.4). In this study, the primary educational status, family size (4-6 and {\textgreater}6), distance from hospital (≥10 km), the presence of a companion and stage of hypertension (stage two) of patients were identified as the predictors of the cost of hypertension illnesses. Conclusion: The cost of hypertension illness was very high when compared to the monthly income of households, exposing patients to catastrophic costs. Hence, the government should give due attention to protect patients from catastrophic health expenditures. © 2020 Zawudie et al.},

Uganda, as many sub-Saharan African countries, increased access to {ART} by decentralizing provision to districts. However, little is known whether this rapid scale-up maintained high-quality clinical services. We assess the quality of {ART} in the Acholi and Lango sub-regions of northern Uganda to identify whether the technical quality of critical {ART} sub-system needs improvement. We conducted a randomized cross-sectional survey among health facilities ({HF}) in Acholi (n = 11) and Lango (n = 10). Applying lot quality assurance sampling principles with a rapid health facility assessment tool, we assessed {ART} services vis-à-vis national treatment guidelines using 37 indicators. We interviewed health workers (n = 21) using structured questionnaires, directly observed clinical consultations (n = 126) and assessed {HF} infrastructure, human resources, medical supplies and patient records in each health facility (n = 21). The district {QoC} performance standard was 80\% of {HF} had to comply with each guideline. Neither sub-region complied with treatment guidelines. No {HF} displayed adequate: patient monitoring, physical examination, training, supervision and regular monitoring of patients' immunology. The full range of first and second line antiretroviral ({ARV}) medication was not available in Acholi while Lango had sufficient stocks. Clinicians dispensed available {ARVs} without benefit of physical examination or immunological monitoring. Patients reported compliance with drug use ({\textgreater}80\%). Patients' knowledge of preventing {HIV}/{AIDS} transmission concentrated on condom use; otherwise it was poor. The poor {ART} {QoC} in northern Uganda raises major questions about {ART} quality although {ARVs} were dispensed. Poor clinical care renders patients' reports of treatment compliance as insufficient evidence that it takes place. Further studies need to test patients' immunological status and {QoC} in more regions of Uganda and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa to identify topical and geographical areas which are priorities for improving {HIV} care. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Cesarean section ({CS}) is an important intervention in complicated births when the safety of the mother or baby is compromised. Despite worldwide concerns about the overutilization of {CS} in recent years, many African women and their newborns still die because of limited or no access to {CS} services. We evaluated temporal and spatial trends in {CS} births in Uganda and modeled future trends to inform programming. Methods: We performed secondary analysis of total births data from the Uganda National Health Management Information System ({HMIS}) reports during 2012-2016. We reviewed data from 3461 health facilities providing basic, essential obstetric and emergency obstetric care services in all 112 districts. We defined facility-based {CS} rate as the proportion of cesarean deliveries among total live births in facilities, and estimated the population-based {CS} rate using the total number of cesarean deliveries as a proportion of annual expected births (including facility-based and non-facility-based) for each district. We predicted {CS} rates for 2021 using Generalised Linear Models with Poisson family, Log link and Unbiased Sandwich Standard errors. We used cesarean deliveries as the dependent variable and calendar year as the independent variable. Results: Cesarean delivery rates increased both at facility and population levels in Uganda. Overall, the {CS} rate for live births at facilities was 9.9\%, increasing from 8.5\% in 2012 to 11\% in 2016. The overall population-based {CS} rate was 4.7\%, and increased from 3.2 to 5.9\% over the same period. Health Centre {IV} level facilities had the largest annual rate of increase in {CS} rate between 2012 and 2016. Among all 112 districts, 80 (72\%) had a population {CS} rate below 5\%, while 38 (34\%) had a {CS} rate below 1\% over the study period. Overall, Uganda's facility-based {CS} rate is projected to increase by 36\% ({PRR} 1.36, 95\% {CI} 1.35-1.36) in 2021 while the population-based {CS} rate is estimated to have doubled ({PRR} 2.12, 95\% {CI} 2.11-2.12) from the baseline in 2016. Conclusion: Cesarean deliveries are increasing in Uganda. Health center {IVs} saw the largest increases in {CS}, and while there was regional heterogeneity in changes in {CS} rates, utilization of {CS} services is inadequate in most districts. We recommend expansion of {CS} services to improve availability. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction: Several measures to assess family planning service quality ({FPQ}) exist, yet there is limited evidence on their association with contraceptive discontinuation. Using data from the Measurement, Learning \& Evaluation ({MLE}) Project, this study investigates the association between {FPQ} and discontinuation-while-in-need without switching in five cities in Kenya. Two measures of {FPQ} are examined - the Method Information Index ({MII}) and a comprehensive service delivery point ({SDP}) assessment rooted in the Bruce Framework for {FPQ}. Methods: Three models were constructed: two to assess {MII} reported in household interviews (as an ordinal and binary variable) among 1,033 {FP} users, and one for facility-level quality domains among 938 {FP} users who could be linked to a facility type included in the {SDP} assessment. Cox proportional hazards ratios were estimated where the event of interest was discontinuation-while-in-need without switching. Facility-level {FPQ} domains were identified using exploratory factor analysis ({EFA}) using {SDP} assessment data from 124 facilities. Results: A woman's likelihood of discontinuation-while-in-need was approximately halved whether she was informed of one aspect of {MII} ({HR}: 0.45, p {\textless} 0.05), or all three ({HR}: 0.51, p {\textless} 0.01) versus receiving no information, when {MII} was assessed as an ordinal variable. Six facility-level quality domains were identified in {EFA}. Higher scores in information exchange, privacy, autonomy \& dignity and technical competence were associated with a reduced risk of discontinuation-while-in-need (p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: The {MII} has potential as an actionable metric for {FPQ} monitoring at the health facility level. Furthermore, family planning facilities and programs should emphasize information provision and client-centered approaches to care alongside technical competence in the provision of {FP} care. © 2020 Feeser K et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Eye care provision is currently insufficient to meet the population’s eye health needs in Kenya. Many people remain unnecessarily visually impaired or at risk of becoming so due to treatable or preventable conditions. A lack of access and awareness of services are key barriers, in large part due to their being too few eye care providers in the health system for this unmet need. Methods: A hospital-based, retrospective analysis of patients who attended Kitale eye unit, Trans Nzoia County, Kenya from 1st January 2013 to 31st December 2015. Age and sex standardized hospital attendance rates by residence, age group, and sex were calculated for Trans Nzoia county and each subcounty. The changing trends in attendance rates were estimated by calculating the difference between base year and last year. Incidence rate ratios for attendance for each age-group, sex, and residence were estimated using a multivariable regression model. Results: 20,695 patients from the county were seen in Kitale Eye Unit in 2013, 2014 and 2015. In that period, 8.3\% had either uncorrected refractive error, cataracts or glaucoma, the priority {VISION}2020 diseases, and 61.0\% had allergic or other conjunctivitis or normal eyes, which could potentially be managed at primary eye care. During the study period, overall average annual attendance rate increased from 609 to 792 per 100, 000 population, incidence rate ratio ({IRR}) 1.30 (95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.26–1.35). Attendance rates increased more in females than males (34.7\% vs. 25.1\%, respectively), {IRR} 1.07 (1.04–1.10). Attendance rates increased with increasing age, (highest among the elderly compared to the young). We found that in extreme age groups ({\textgreater}75 years and {\textless}15years) females were less likely to attend than males and there was reduced utilization from those based furthest from the hospital. Conclusion: Specialist eye services are heavily utilized by people with conditions that could be managed at the primary health care level. Barriers to accessing eye services were distance and gender, especially among the most vulnerable groups (young and the elderly). Integration of primary and secondary eye care services could lower barriers to essential eye care services to the population whilst lowering pressure on the limited specialist services by ensuring more appropriate utilization. © 2019 by the authors.

To explore how international standards translate into local realities, we conducted a team ethnography, involving observations in labor wards in government facilities in central Malawi, and interviews and focus groups with midwives, women, and guardians. We identified a dual disconnect between, first, universal {RMC} principles and local notions of good care and, second, between midwives and women and guardians. The latter disconnect pertains to fraught relationships, reproduced by and manifested in mechanistic care, mutual responsibilization for trouble, and misunderstandings and distrust. {RMC} initiatives should be tailored to local contexts and midwife-client relationships. In a hierarchical, resource-strapped context like Malawi, promoting mutual love, understanding, and collaboration may be a more productive way to stimulate “respectful” care than the current emphasis on formal rights and respect. © The Author(s) 2019.},

Periodic assessments of the quality of malaria case management and routine data are a critical activity for the malaria program. {InMay}-June 2018, survey teams visited 126 health facilities in six health districts purposefully selected to represent a spectrum (Stratum 1-high, Stratum 2-intermediate, and Stratum 3-low) of perceived quality of case management and reporting, as assessed from an a priori analysis of routine data. Surveyors performed exit interviews with 939 outpatients and compared results with registry data for interviewed patients. Availability of rapid diagnostic tests ({RDTs}) and artemisinin-based combination therapies ({ACTs}) was 100\% in Strata 1 and 2, compared with 82\% (95\% {CI}: 63-92\%) for {RDTs} and 86\% (68-95\%) for any formulation of {ACT} in Stratum 3. Correct case management for suspect malaria cases was 85\% in both Stratum 1 (95\% {CI}: 78-90\%) and Stratum 2 (79-89\%), but only 52\% (37-67\%) in Stratum 3. Concordance between exit interviews and registry entries for key malaria indicators was significantly higher in Strata 1 and 2 than in Stratum 3. Both adherence to national guidelines for testing and treatment and data quality were high in Strata 1 and 2, but substandard in Stratum 3. The survey results reflected the trends seen in the routine data, suggesting that analysis of routine data can identify areas requiring more attention to improve malaria case management and reporting. © 2019 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite improvement in the coverage of most maternal, newborn, and child health services, inequality in the uptake of services still remains the challenge of health systems in most developing countries. This study was conducted to examine the degree of inequities and potential predictors of inequity in reproductive and maternal health services utilization in the Oromia region, Ethiopia. Methods: The 2016 Ethiopian demographic and health survey data set was used. Utilization rate of four maternal health service categories (family planning, antenatal care, facility based delivery and postnatal care) was considered in the analysis. Equity in each of these indicators was assessed by residence (urban/rural), wealth index, and educational status. Inequality in service utilization was estimated using rate ratios, concentration curve, and concentration indices. Results: Overall data of 5701 women were used in this analysis. The concentration index to all of the maternal health service utilization indicators showed significance. The concentration index of family planning, antenatal care, facility based delivery, and postnatal care was 0.136 (95\% {CI}=0.099-0.173), 0.106 (95\% {CI}=0.035-0.177), 0.348 (95\% {CI}=0.279-0.418), and 0.348 (95\% {CI}=0.279-0.418), respectively. Maternal age and all of the three socio-demographic factors (residence, education, and wealth) showed inequitable distribution of maternal health service utilization in the Oromia region. The majority of women who were in the favored groups utilized the key reproductive and maternal health services. Conclusion: The utilization of maternal health services in the study area is grossly skewed to those who are well off, educated, and live in urban areas. Any action intended to improve utilization of maternal and child health services should aim to reduce the unnecessary and avoidable disparity demonstrated in our analysis. This of course demands multisectoral intervention to impact on the determinants. © 2020 Gebreslassie Gebrehiwot et al.},

	abstract = {Background Both under and overnutrition have been associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Hence, quality nutrition services are essential during pregnancy to help ensuring a healthy diet for expecting women especially in countries where malnutrition including anaemia is high, such as Senegal. Based on the Donabedian model of quality of care, the offer of nutrition services during antenatal care ({ANC}) was assessed in health facilities of Kolda region, Senegal. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted among a random sample comprising 30\% of the {ANC} providers of the region. Data on conditions and environment of health facilities were collected through direct observations as well as information on available equipment, materials and drugs/supplements. Data on {ANC} workforce such as their qualifications and supervision were gathered through a questionnaire. {ANC} providers were also asked to self-report their offer of nutrition services, including counseling. Results With the exception of blood analyses equipment as well as calcium and energy-protein supplements, over 90\% of health facilities had materials, equipment and supplies for providing nutrition services. {ANC} providers were either midwives or nurses as required by national standards but over 60\% were not supervised every two months as prescribed. About 20\% of them had received some training in maternal nutrition. Only 30\% of {ANC} providers reported asking pregnant women about eating habits including the use of iodized salt, resting and sleeping habits and 15\% on night blindness. Regarding nutrition counseling, 60\% mentioned that they were always providing general dietary advice, 50\% recommended specific foods to gain weight and 20\% reported talking always about potential side effects of iron and folic acid supplementation. Conclusions Although health providers have qualifications to perform {ANC} and work in a conducive environment, their capacities to provide nutrition services may be suboptimal. To some extent, this situation may contribute to the limited offer of nutrition services. © 2020, International Society of Global Health. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The management quality of healthcare facilities has consistently been linked to facility performance, but available tools to measure management are costly to implement, often hospital-specific, not designed for low- and middle-income countries ({LMICs}), nor widely deployed. We addressed this gap by developing the {PRImary} care facility Management Evaluation Tool ({PRIME}-Tool), a primary health care facility management survey for integration into routine national surveys in {LMICs}. We present an analysis of the tool's psychometric properties and suggest directions for future improvements. Methods: The {PRIME}-Tool assesses performance in five core management domains: Target setting, Operations, Human resources, Monitoring, and Community engagement. We evaluated two versions of the {PRIME}-Tool. We surveyed 142 primary health care ({PHC}) facilities in Ghana in 2016 using the first version (27 items) and 148 facilities in 2017 using the second version (34 items). We calculated floor and ceiling effects for each item and conducted exploratory factor analyses to examine the factor structure for each year and version of the tool. We developed a revised management framework and {PRIME}-tool as informed by these exploratory results, further review of management theory literature, and co-author consensus. Results: The majority (17 items in 2016, 23 items in 2017) of {PRIME}-Tool items exhibited ceiling effects, but only three (2 items in 2016, 3 items in 2017) showed floor effects. Solutions suggested by factor analyses did not fully fit our initial hypothesized management domains. We found five groupings of items that consistently loaded together across each analysis and named these revised domains as Supportive supervision and target setting, Active monitoring and review, Community engagement, Client feedback for improvement, and Operations and financing. Conclusion: The revised version of the {PRIME}-Tool captures a range of important and actionable information on the management of {PHC} facilities in {LMIC} contexts. We recommend its use by other investigators and practitioners to further validate its utility in {PHC} settings. We will continue to refine the {PRIME}-Tool to arrive at a parsimonious tool for tracking {PHC} facility management quality. Better understanding the functional components of {PHC} facility management can help policymakers and frontline managers drive evidence-based improvements in performance. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Past studies have identified that inconvenient access to health clinics is one of the important barriers to health service utilization and health outcomes. However, establishing the link between the lack of access to health clinics and the high maternal and child morbidity and mortality in Nigeria has been a challenge due to the lack of data. This paper overcomes this problem by using the country's health clinic census data. Methods: Using the Nigerian health clinic census, we evaluate the intercorrelation between the quantity and the quality of health clinics available across the country. We also examine the correlation between the access to health clinics and health behaviors/outcomes for residents by merging the health clinic census data with data from the demographic and health survey ({DHS}). The health clinic census data makes it possible to capture the overall geographical allocation of health services across the country as well as their comprehensive relationship with health outcomes. Results: We find a strong positive correlation between the quality of a health clinic and the quantity and quality of neighboring clinics. The high quality clinics are concentrated in areas where the density of clinics is high, and where more of the clinics around them are also of high quality. We also find that an increase in access to health clinics of high quality that are in close proximity is significantly and positively correlated with an improvement in health behaviors as well as health outcomes. Women who are more disadvantaged benefit more from the access to high quality clinics than others. Conclusions: Health clinics of good quality are unevenly distributed geographically in Nigeria. The quality of health clinics should be of a level that can support the promotion of recommended health behaviors and achieve improved health outcomes throughout the country. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the optimal distribution of clinics of good quality, given that residents in less populated areas gain a higher marginal benefit from improved access to health service, despite the higher costs of supplying the service in those areas. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: All pregnancies are at risk and have to be attended by skilled professionals. In Ethiopia however nearly half (45.7\%) of the women were giving birth at home after antenatal care ({ANC}) visits in which skilled professionals were not available. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess spatial clustering and the determinant factors of home delivery after antenatal care visits in Ethiopia. Methods: A case control study was conducted on 2110 mothers who gave birth at home after {ANC} (cases), and 2510 mothers who gave birth at health institutions after attending {ANC} (controls), based on {EDHS} 2016 data. As per the recommendations of the {DHS} program, we weighed the data before analysis. {ArcGIS} 10.3 was used to show spatial pattern and {SaTScan}™ 9.4 to identify significant clusters. Stata 14 was used for data cleaning, weighing, and the analysis of the determinant factors. Bi variable and multi variable multilevel mixed effect logistic regression was fitted. Finally, the Log-likelihood ratio ({LLR}) and Relative risk with p-value of spatial scan statistics and {AOR} with 95\% {CI} for significant determinant factors were reported. Results: Home delivery after {ANC} was spatially clustered in Ethiopia (Moran's Index = 0.91, p-value{\textless} 0.01). Attending, 1-3 {ANC} visits ({AOR} = 1.41, 95\%{CI}: 1.17-1.71), no information about birth preparedness plan ({AOR} = 2.21, 95\%{CI}: 1.83-2.69), pregnancies wanted later ({AOR} = 1.55, 95\%{CI}: 1.20, 2.06), not having health insurance ({AOR} = 2.16, 95\% {CI}: 1.29, 3.62), Muslim ({AOR} = 1.57, 95\% {CI}: 1.13, 2.19) and protestant ({AOR} = 1.72, 95\%{CI}: 1.16, 2.42) religions were positively associated with home delivery; While being rich ({AOR} = 0.42, 95\%{CI}: 0.32-0.54), middle wealth index ({AOR} = O.66, 95\%{CI}: 0.51, 0.86), primary education ({AOR} = 0.45, 95\%{CI}: 0.36-0.55), secondary education ({AOR} = 0.11, 95\%{CI}: 0.07-0.16), above secondary education ({AOR} = 0.06, 95\%{CI}: 0.03-0.11) were negatively associated. Conclusions: Home delivery after {ANC} follow ups was spatially clustered. Socio-demographic, health service and pregnancy related factors determined the prevalence of home delivery after antenatal care visits. Strengthening women's education, {ANC} visit, giving more information about birth preparedness plan, and improving family wealth are vital to reduce home delivery after antenatal care visits. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Approximately 214 million women of reproductive age lack adequate access to contraception for their family planning needs, yet patterns of contraceptive availability have seldom been examined. With growing demand for contraceptives in some areas, low contraceptive method availability and stockouts are thought to be major drivers of unmet need among women of reproductive age, though evidence for this is limited. In this research, we examined trends in stockouts, method availability and consumption of specific contraceptive methods in urban areas of four sub-Saharan African countries (Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and Nigeria) and India. We used representative survey data from the Performance Monitoring for Action Agile Project that were collected in quarterly intervals at service delivery points ({SDP}) stratified by sector (public vs private), with all countries having five to six quarters of surveys between 2017 and 2019. Among {SDPs} that offer family planning, we calculated the percentage offering at least one type of modern contraceptive method ({MCM}) for each country and quarter, and by sector. We examined trends in the percentage of {SDPs} with stockouts and which currently offer condoms, emergency contraception, oral pills, injectables, intrauterine devices and implants. We also examined trends of client visits for specific methods and the resulting estimated protection from pregnancy by quarter and country. Across all countries, the vast majority of {SDPs} had at least one type of {MCM} in-stock during the study period. We find that the frequency of stockouts varies by method and sector and is much more dynamic than previously thought. While the availability and distribution of long-acting reversible contraceptives ({LARCs}) were limited compared to other methods across countries, {LARCs} nonetheless consistently accounted for a larger portion of couple years of protection. We discuss findings that show the importance of engaging the private sector towards achieving global and national family planning goals.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

However, currently there is no system in Sierra Leone for recording and reporting on antibiotic consumption. We therefore conducted a cross-sectional study to assess national antibiotic consumption expressed as defined daily dose ({DDD}) per 1000 inhabitants per day using all registered and imported antibiotics (categorized under the subgroup J01 under the anatomical and therapeutic classification ({ATC}) system) as a proxy. Between 2017–2019, total cumulative consumption of antibiotics was 19 {DDD} per 1000 inhabitants per day. The vast majority consisted of oral antibiotics (98.4\%), while parenteral antibiotics made up 1.6\%. According to therapeutic/pharmacological subgroups ({ATC} level 3), beta-lactam/penicillins, quinolones, and other antibacterials (mainly oral metronidazole) comprised 65\% of total consumption. According to {WHO} Access, Watch, and Reserve ({AWaRe}), 65\% of antibiotics consumed were Access, 31\% were Watch, and no Reserve antibiotics were reported. The top ten oral antibiotics represented 97\% of total oral antibiotics consumed, with metronidazole (35\%) and ciprofloxacin (15\%) together constituting half of the total. Of parenteral antibiotics con-sumed, procaine penicillin (32\%) and ceftriaxone (19\%) together comprised half of the total.

Approximately 40\% of births are unattended by skilled healthcare personnel with high out-of-pocket expenditures. Poor resource allocation, poorly functioning referral systems, long trekking distances to health facilities, all of which lead to low rates of use of maternal health services. Objectives: The aim of this pilot study is to explore perception and acceptability of mobile health (mhealth) and e-voucher and to determine the feasibility of conducting a large cluster randomized trial to determine the effects of combining e-vouchers and a mobile application compared with usual care in improving access to and use of maternal health services. Methods: This is a multimethod study that comprises two phases. The first phase is the development of the mobile phone app, which includes a qualitative formative study through in-depth key informant interviews and focus group discussions. The second phase is a cluster randomized control trial assessing the combination of e-vouchers and a mobile application compared with usual care in improving access to and use of maternal health services. Feasibility will be determined based on evaluating randomization, contamination, enrollment rate, complete follow up, compliance rate, success in matching data from different sources, and data completeness. Ethics and discussion: Ethics approval has been granted, and the trial has been registered in the Pan-African Clinical Trials Registry. We will disseminate our findings through peer-reviewed manuscripts and conference presentations. Findings from this study will inform the design and conduct of a larger randomized trial.

	abstract = {Background: Liberia has a severe shortage in the health workforce, which is amplified in rural areas. Many talented Liberians leave the country for post-graduate education; those physicians who do stay are concentrated in Monrovia. Objective: We initiated a family medicine specialty training program ({FMSTP}) to increase the number of well-trained physicians who have the knowledge, skills, and commitment to meet the health needs of the Liberian people. Methods: The Liberian College of Physicians and Surgeons ({LCPS}) family medicine program is a three-year post-graduate course that follows the West African College of Physician ({WACP}) curriculum. The program has a longitudinal rural training component supported by Partners in Health in Maryland county, where residents gain experience in a remote and under-served region. The program is evaluated through resident evaluations and ultimately bench-marked by accreditation and exam pass rates. Findings: The {FMSTP} commenced in July 2017, and the first rural rotation was in January 2018. To-date 13 residents have completed a total of 43 rotations in Maryland. Residents surveyed highly rated the faculty and their rural rotations. They identify more hands-on involvement in patient care, exposure to community health, and one-on-one time with faculty as the greatest assets of the rural training experience. Accreditation from the {WACP} was granted in December 2018. One of the graduating residents from the first class in 2020 is now serving as the first Liberian family medicine specialist in Maryland County. Discussion: Investing in a strong rural training component in our {FMSTP} has not only strengthened the program but has also built the infrastructure to establish our rural site as an attractive teaching hospital for intern doctors and nursing students. As the program continues to grow, success will be measured by the proportion of Liberian medical students entering the family medicine training program, retention of family medicine physicians in rural areas, and ultimately progress towards universal health coverage ({UHC}). © 2021 The Author(s).},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pntd.0008149},
	abstract = {Background Individual behavior, particularly choices about prevention, plays a key role in infection transmission of vector-borne diseases ({VBDs}). Since the actual risk of infection is often uncertain, individual behavior is influenced by the perceived risk. A low risk perception is likely to diminish the use of preventive measures (behavior). If risk perception is a good indicator of the actual risk, then it has important implications in a context of disease elimination. However, more research is needed to improve our understanding of the role of human behavior in disease transmission. The objective of this study is to explore whether preventive behavior is responsive to risk perception, taking into account the links with disease knowledge and controlling for individuals’ socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. More specifically, the study focuses on malaria, dengue fever, Zika and cutaneous leishmaniasis ({CL}), using primary data collected in Guyana–a key country for the control and/or elimination of {VBDs}, given its geographic location. Methods and findings The data were collected between August and December 2017 in four regions of the country. Questions on disease knowledge, risk perception and self-reported use of preventive measures were asked to each participant for the four diseases. A structural equation model was estimated. It focused on data collected from private households only in order to control for individuals’ socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, which led to a sample size of 497 participants. The findings showed evidence of a bidirectional association between risk perception and behavior. A one-unit increase in risk perception translated into a 0.53 unit increase in self-reported preventive behavior for all diseases, while a one-unit increase in self-reported preventive behavior (i.e. the use of an additional measure) led to a 0.46 unit decrease in risk perception for all diseases (except {CL}). This study also showed that higher education significantly improves knowledge and that better knowledge increases the take up of preventive measures for malaria and dengue, without affecting risk perception. Conclusions In trying to reach elimination, it appears crucial to promote awareness of the risks and facilitate access to preventive measures, so that lower risk perception does not translate into lower preventive behavior. © 2020 Aerts et al.},

An evaluation of the Helping Mothers Survive Bleeding After Birth ({HMS} {BAB}) training as a single-component intervention in Tanzania found some positive albeit limited effect on clinical management and reduction of postpartum haemorrhage ({PPH}). Aim: In order to better understand these findings, and particularly the contribution of contextual factors on the observed effects, we explored health workers’ perceptions of their health facilities’ readiness to provide {PPH} care. Methods: We conducted 7 focus group discussions ({FGDs}) and 12 in-depth interviews ({IDIs}) in purposively selected intervention districts in the {HMS} {BAB} trial. {FGDs} and {IDIs} were audio-recorded, transcribed and translated verbatim. Thematic analysis, using both inductive and deductive approaches, was applied with the help of {MAXQDA} software. Results: Health workers perceive that their facilities have a low readiness to provide {PPH} care, leading to stressful situations and suboptimal clinical management. They describe inconsistencies in essential supplies, fluctuating availability of blood for transfusion, and ineffective referral system. In addition, there are challenges in collaboration, communication and leadership support, which is perceived to prevent effective management of cases within the facility as well as in referral situations. Health workers strive to provide life-saving care to women with {PPH} despite the perceived challenges. In some health facilities, health workers perceive supportive clinical leadership as motivating in providing good care. Conclusion: The potential positive effects of single-component interventions such as {HMS} {BAB} training on clinical outcome may be constraint by poor health facility readiness, including communication, leadership and referral processes that need to be addressed. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Emergency medicine as a field of study was first initiated at Alexandria University in 1978, but it was only formally recognized as a medical specialty in 2002. Since then, the prehospital system and practice of emergency medicine has evolved and grown. Objectives: This article will outline the development of emergency medicine in Egypt, including infrastructure, education, specialty certification, and future challenges, including those which are common to other specialties in development, and also those which are unique to Egypt. Discussion: Opportunities remain with respect to the development of emergency medicine in Egypt, most notably in a continuing ‘brain drain’ of physicians who leave the country after receiving training, supervision, and oversight of residency programs, and general public and professional awareness of this new specialty. Conclusion: Egypt has made great strides with respect to the delivery of emergency services, physician education and certification within the specialty of emergency medicine. Learning about these developments in Egypt will provide the reader with a compelling example of how an emergency system is developed in an advancing national setting. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Objectives To measure the provision of evidence-based preventive and promotive interventions to women, and subsequently their newborns, during childbirth in a high-mortality setting. Design and participants Cross-sectional observations of care provided to women, and their newborns during the intrapartum and immediate postpartum period using a standardised checklist capturing healthcare worker behaviours regarding lifesaving and respectful care. Setting Ten primary healthcare facilities in Gombe state, northeast Nigeria. The northeast region of Nigeria has some of the highest maternal and newborn death rates globally. Main outcome measures Data on 50 measures of internationally recommended evidence-based interventions and good practice. Results 1875 women were admitted to a health facility during the observation period; of these, 1804 gave birth in the facility and did not experience an adverse event or death. Many clinical interventions around the time of birth were routinely implemented, including provision of uterotonic (96\% (95\% {CI} 93\% to 98\%)), whereas risk-assessment measures, such as history-taking or checking vital signs were rarely completed: just 2\% (95\% {CI} 2\% to 7\%) of women had their temperature taken and 12\% (95\% {CI} 9\% to 16\%) were asked about complications during the pregnancy. Conclusions The majority of women did not receive the recommended routine processes of childbirth care they and their newborns needed to benefit from their choice to deliver in a health facility. In particular, few benefited from even basic risk assessments, leading to missed opportunities to identify risks. To continue with the recommendation of childbirth care in primary healthcare facilities in high mortality settings like Gombe, it is crucial that birth attendant capacity, capability and prioritisation processes are addressed. © 2020 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

	abstract = {Background Tuberculosis ({TB}) remains a key health menace in Ethiopia and its districts. This study aimed to assess the spatial-temporal clustering of notified pulmonary {TB} ({PTB}) cases in East Gojjam Zone, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A retrospective study was conducted among all {PTB} cases reported from 2013–2019. Case notification rates ({CNRs}) of {PTB} cases at Kebele (the lowest administrative unit), woreda, and zone levels were estimated. The {PTB} clustering was done using global Moran’s I statistics on Arc {GIS} 10.6. We used Kulldorff {SaTScan} 9.6 with a discrete Poisson model to identify statistically significant spatial-temporal clustering of {PTB} cases at Kebele level. Similarly, a negative binomial regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with the incidence of {PTB} cases at kebele level. Results A total of 5340 (52\%) smear-positive and 4928 (48\%) smear-negative {PTB} cases were analyzed. The overall mean {CNR} of {PTB} cases at zone, woreda and Kebele levels were 58(47–69), 82(56–204), and 69(36–347) per 100,000 population, respectively. The purely spatial cluster analysis identified eight most likely clusters (one for overall and one per year for seven reporting years) and 47 secondary clusters. Similarly, the space-time scan analysis identified one most likely and seven secondary clusters. The purely temporal analysis also detected one most likely cluster from 2013–2015. Rural residence, distance from the nearest health facility, and poor {TB} service readiness were factors (p-value {\textless}0.05) to {PTB} incidence at kebele level. Conclusion The distribution of {PTB} cases was clustered. The {PTB} {CNR} was low and showed a decreasing trend during the reporting periods. Rural residence, distance from the health facilities, and poor facility readiness were factors of {PTB} incidence. Improving accessibility and readiness of health facilities mainly to rural and hotspot areas is vital to increase case detection and reduce {TB} transmission. © 2021 Asemahagn et al.

	abstract = {Background In 2018, the World Health Assembly mandated Member States to take action on rheumatic heart disease ({RHD}), which persists in countries with weak health systems. We conducted an assessment of the current state of {RHD}-related healthcare in Uganda. Methodology/Principal findings This was a mixed-methods, deductive simultaneous design study conducted in four districts of Uganda. Using census sampling, we surveyed health facilities in each district using an {RHD} survey instrument that was modeled after the {WHO} {SARA} tool. We interviewed health workers with experience managing {RHD}, purposively sampling to ensure a range of qualifi-cation and geographic variation. Our final sample included 402 facilities and 36 health work-ers. We found major gaps in knowledge of clinical guidelines and availability of diagnostic tests. Antibiotics used in {RHD} prevention were widely available, but cardiovascular medica-tions were scarce. Higher levels of service readiness were found among facilities in the western region (Mbarara district) and private facilities. Level {III} health centers were the most prepared for delivering secondary prevention. Health worker interviews revealed that limited awareness of {RHD} at the district level, lack of diagnostic tests and case management regis-tries, and absence of clearly articulated {RHD} policies and budget prioritization were the main barriers to providing {RHD}-related healthcare. Conclusions/Significance Uganda’s readiness to implement the World Health Assembly {RHD} Resolution is low. The forthcoming national {RHD} strategy must focus on decentralizing {RHD} diagnosis and prevention to the district level, emphasizing specialized training of the primary healthcare workforce and strengthening supply chains of diagnostics and essential medicines. © 2021 Ndagire et al.},

	abstract = {Background Neonatal infections remain a leading cause of newborn deaths globally. In 2015, {WHO} issued guidelines for managing possible serious bacterial infection ({PSBI}) in young infants (0–59 days) using simplified antibiotic regimens when compliance with hospital referral is not feasible. Bangladesh was one of the first countries to adopt {WHO}’s guidelines for implementation. We report results of an implementation research study that assessed facility readiness and provider performance in three rural sub-districts of Bangladesh during August 2015-August 2016. Methods This study took place in 19 primary health centers. Facility readiness was assessed using checklists completed by study staff at three time points. To assess provider performance, we extracted data for all infection cases from facility registers and compared providers’ diagnosis and treatment against the guidelines. We plotted classification and dosage errors across the study period and superimposed a locally weighted smoothed ({LOWESS}) curve to analyze changes in performance over time. Focus group discussions (N = 2) and in-depth interviews (N = 28) with providers were conducted to identify barriers and facilitators for facility readiness and provider performance. Results At baseline, none of the facilities had adequate supply of antibiotics. During the 10-month period, 606 sick infants with signs of infection presented at the study facilities. Classification errors were identified in 14.9\% (N = 90/606) of records. For infants receiving the first dose(s) of antibiotic treatment (N = 551), dosage errors were identified in 22.9\% (N = 126/551) of the records. Distribution of errors varied by facility (35.7\% [{IQR}: 24.7–57.4\%]) and infection severity. Errors were highest at the beginning of the study period and decreased over time. Qualitative data suggest errors in early implementation were due to changes in providers’ assessment and treatment practices, including confusion about classifying an infant with multiple signs of infection, and some providers’ concerns about the efficacy of simplified antibiotic regimens. Conclusions Strategies to monitor early performance and targeted supports are important for enhancing implementation fidelity when introducing complex guidelines in new settings. Future research should examine providers’ assessment of effectiveness of simplified treatment and address misconceptions about superiority of broader spectrum antibiotics for treating community-acquired neonatal infections in this context. © 2020 World Health Organization.

	abstract = {Equity in health care financing has gained increased attention in low- and middle-income countries ({LMICs}) following the renewed global interest in universal health coverage ({UHC}), a key component of the sustainable development goals ({SDGs}). {UHC} requires that people have access to the health services they need without risking financial hardship. Health financing is central to {UHC} and many {LMICs} have initiated reforms to align their health financing systems with the goals of {UHC}. Evaluation of the equity impact of these reforms has become a growing area of research, especially in countries with large health inequalities where the pressure to move towards {UHC} is most intense and the need for evidence to inform policy most critical. However, current analytical tools for evaluating equity in health financing conspicuously exclude indicators of quality, an important dimension of {UHC}. The aim of this paper was to address this critical methodological gap by introducing quality scores into benefit incidence analysis ({BIA}), one of the key techniques for assessing equity in health financing. {BIA} measures the extent to which different socioeconomic groups benefit from public spending on health care through their use of health services. The benefit (public subsidy) is captured in monetary terms by multiplying the quantity of a particular health service consumed by the unit cost of that service and subtracting any out-of-pocket costs incurred while using the service. It does not account for variations in the quality of health services in the computation of the public subsidy. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Systematic review of the literature aligned with the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ({PRISMA}), including observational and intervention studies. No restrictions were established for period or country of publication; studies published in Spanish, English and Portuguese were included. The search was carried out in {MEDLINE}, {CINAHL}, {LILACS}, {EMBASE} and Web of Science electronic databases. Results. Eighteen studies were analyzed, including 6 from the United States; 3 from the Netherlands; 2 from the United Kingdom; 1 each from Australia, South Africa, South Korea, Scotland, Haiti and Japan; and 1 study with a prospective observational design from 8 countries. The studies reported that the skill mix among health professionals enables a better use of material resources; optimizes time spent on care; improves adhesion to treatment, quality of care and commitment and satisfaction with the work; and reduces the level of psychological distress in nursing professionals. Conclusions. The expansion of tasks of nurses and other health care professionals, and the skill mix as well as the development of interprofessional teams, are strategies that help to face a scarcity and poor distribution of human resources in urban and non-urban areas with improvement of the health care of the population and satisfaction of professionals and clients. © 2020 Pan American Health Organization.

However, rigorous evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of these strategies in lower-income countries such as Ghana. This study aimed to determine the effect of a combined {CDSS}-{PBI} intervention on client satisfaction with maternal health services in primary facilities in the Upper East Region of Ghana. Methods We employed a quasi-experimental controlled baseline and endline design to assess the effect of the combined interventions on client satisfaction with maternal health services, measured by quantitative pre/post-test client satisfaction survey. Our analysis used difference-in-difference logistic regression, controlling for potential covariates, to compare variables across intervention and comparison facilities at baseline and endline. Results The combined {CDSS}-{PBI} intervention was associated with increased or unchanged client satisfaction with all maternal health services compared at endline. Antenatal client difference-in-difference of mean satisfaction scores were significant at endline for intervention (n = 378) and comparison (n = 362) healthcare facilities for overall satisfaction ({DiD} 0.058, p = 0.014), perception of providers’ technical performance ({DiD} = 0.142; p = 0.006), client-provider interaction ({DiD} = 0.152; p = 0.001), and provider availability ({DiD} = 0.173; p = 0.001). Delivery client difference-in-difference of satisfaction scores were significant at endline for intervention (n = 318) and comparison (n = 240) healthcare facilities for overall satisfaction with delivery services ({DiD} = 0.072; p = 0.02) and client-provider interaction ({DiD} = 0.146; p = 0.02). However, mean overall satisfaction actually reduced slightly in intervention facilities, while {DiD} for technical performance and provider availability were not significant. Conclusion This combined {CDSS}-{PBI} intervention was associated with greater antenatal and delivery client satisfaction with some aspects of maternity services within two years of implementation. It could be expanded elsewhere if funds allow, though further research is still required to assess cost-effectiveness and long-term effects on client satisfaction and maternal health outcomes.

	abstract = {Background: Schistosomiasis (S. mansoni and S. haematobium) is an important neglected tropical disease in sub-Saharan Africa including Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, Schistosomiasis has been prioritized as neglected tropical disease and remained among major public health burden on school age children of the country. Few studies conducted on the association between prevalence of Schistosomiasis and gender of school age children have inconclusive finding about the association between these two variables. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was done to determine the pooled prevalence of Schistosomiasis and its association with gender of school age children in Ethiopia. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, databases such as: Medline/{PubMed}, {EMBASE}, {CINAHL}, Cochrane Central library, Google Scholar, and {HINARI} were systematically searched. {STATA} version 14 was used to estimate pooled prevalence of Schistosomiasis using random effects model with 95\% confidence interval. The results were presented by using forest plot and statistical heterogeneity was checked by using the Cochran Q test (chi-squared statistic), I2 test statistic and by visual examination of the forest plot. Results: From the total of 427 studies identified for this review, 50 studies were included in the final analysis. The analysis noted that pooled prevalence of Schistosomiasis in Ethiopia was 28.78\% (95\% {CI}: 23.81, 33.74). The subgroup analysis indicated that extreme variability was observed in the prevalence of Schistosomiasis across the regions of the country. The highest (39.77\%) prevalence of Schistosomiasis was reported from the southern region, whereas the lowest (14.95\%) prevalence of Schistosomiasis was reported from Afar region. Male school age children were 58\% more likely infected with Schistosomiasis than female school age children in Ethiopia ({OR}: 1.58, 95\% {CI}: 1.33, 1.83). Conclusions: The Prevalence of Schistosomiasis was higher than the 2018 report of the Ethiopian federal ministry of health. The prevalence of Schistosomiasis was predominant among male gender of the school age children. Therefore, sustainable control of Schistosomiasis requires the approaches that must go beyond current deworming program. Complementary prevention strategies including health education, safe water and adequate sanitary facilities provision should be simultaneously implemented. The underlining causes of variation in risk factors of Schistosomiasis among males and females should be further studied. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: The continuum of maternal care has been one of the effective approaches for improving the health of mothers and newborns. Although large numbers of Ethiopian women do not use maternal health services, points of drop out along the continuum are not understood well. Understanding of a particular point of maternal care dropout on the continuum, however, helps governments make effective interventions. This study aimed to assess the extent of women's service utilization and the factors affecting retention on the continuum of care in West Gojjam Zone, Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based study linked to health facility data was conducted in June 2018. Data were obtained from 1281 mothers who gave birth to their last baby within the preceding 12 months from a two-stage cluster sampling. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews using a pretested questionnaire. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine the effects of individual and cluster-level factors on key elements of the continuum of care. The measure of fixed effects was expressed as Odds Ratio with 95\% confidence interval. Results: The study revealed that only 12.1\% of women completed the continuum of maternal care services ({ANC}4+, {SBA}, and {PNC} within 2 days after birth); while 25.1\% of them did not receive any care during their recent births. There were commonalities and differences in the predictors of the three indicators of maternal health service utilization. Variables related to services received during antenatal care such as early initiation of {ANC} ({AOR} = 7.53, 95\%{CI}, 2.94, 19.29) and receiving proper contents ({AOR} = 3.31, 95\%{CI}, 1.08, 10.16) were among the predictors significantly associated with the completion of the continuum of care. Conclusions: The continuum of maternal care completion rate was extremely low, indicating that women were not getting the maximum possible health benefit from existing health services. The results also revealed that maternal health service utilization was influenced by factors operating at various levels-individual, household, community, and health facility. Since antenatal care is considered an entry point for the subsequent use of maternal services, strategies that aimed to improve maternal health service utilization should target early initiation and antenatal care quality. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background Several performance-based financing ({PBF}) evaluations have been undertaken in low-income countries, yet few have examined community perspectives of care amid {PBF} programme implementation. We assessed community members' perspectives of Support for Service Delivery Integration - Performance-Based Incentives ('{SSDI}-{PBI}'), a {PBF} intervention in Malawi, and explored some of the unintended effects that emerged amid implementation. Methods We conducted 30 focus group discussions: 17 with community leaders and 13 with mothers within catchment areas of {SSDI}-{PBI} implementing facilities. We analysed data using the framework approach. Results Community leaders and women had mixed impressions regarding the effect of {SSDI}-{PBI} on service delivery in facilities. They highlighted several improvements (including improved dialogue between staff and community, and cleaner, better-equipped facilities with enhanced privacy), but also persisting challenges (including inadequate and overworked staff, overcrowded facilities and long distances to facilities) related to services in {SSDI}-{PBI}-implementing facilities. Further, respondents described how four targeted service indicators related to maternal risk factor management, antenatal care ({ANC}) in the first trimester, skilled birth attendance and couple's {HIV} testing sparked unintended negative effects as experienced by women and communities. The unintended effects included women returning home for delivery, women feeling uncertain about their pregnancy status, women feeling betrayed or frustrated by the quality of care provided and partnerless women being denied {ANC}. Conclusion {PBF} programmes such as {SSDI}-{PBI} may improve some aspects of service delivery. However, to achieve system improvement, not only should necessary tools (such as medicines, equipment and human resources) be in place, but also programme priorities must be congruent with cultural expectations. Finally, facilities must be better supported to expect and then address increases in client load and heightened expectations in relation to services. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to identify the extent of antenatal care content received and associated factors among Ethiopian women. Methods: A nationally representative Performance Monitoring for Action 2020 Ethiopian data were used. A multistage cluster sampling design was used to select 2855 pregnant or recently postpartum women nested within 217 enumeration areas. Female resident enumera-tors collected the data using a semi-structured questionnaire. Researchers dichotomized the number of {ANC} content received greater than or equal to 75 percentiles as adequate. Otherwise, it was considered inadequate. A multilevel Poisson regression was fitted. The result was reported using an incidence rate ratio with a 95\% confidence interval and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered for statistical significance. Results: The study revealed more than a quarter of pregnant women received adequate {ANC} content (27.8\%; 95\% {CI}: 23.8\%, 32.2\%). Multivariable analysis revealed urban residence ({IRR} = 1.09, 95\% {CI}: 1.01, 1.21), attending secondary and above formal education ({IRR} = 1.08, 95\% {CI}: 1.01, 1.16), maternal age 20–24 years ({IRR} = 1.10, 95\% {CI}: 1.02, 1.19), and partner’s encouragement to attend clinic for antenatal care ({IRR} = 1.14, 95\% {CI}: 1.05, 1.24) was significantly associated with receiving higher numbers of antenatal care content. Conclusion: The proportion of women who received adequate antenatal care content in Ethiopia was low. Despite Ethiopia’s effort to improve maternal health services utilization, disparities among regions and between rural and urban exist. This study highlights the importance of ensuring high received antenatal care content, which is crucial for reducing pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality. This implies prompt intersectoral collaboration to promote female education, target older aged women, and rural resident women, encourage partner involvements during the antenatal care process, minimize regional variation, and strengthen the implementation of received {ANC} content policies and programs with the active participation of the stakeholders are priority issues. © 2021 Shiferaw et al.},

These drivers include complex so-called hardware (structural and resource) and software (values and norms, and human relations and interactions) factors. Two groups of software factors emerge as essential enablers of effective integration of {SRH} and {HIV} services that often interact with systems hardware: (1) leadership, management, and governance processes and (2) provider motivation, agency, and relationships. Evidence suggests the potential for software elements that are essential enablers to overcome some of the obstacles posed by the non-integration of health system hardware elements (eg, financing, guidelines, and commodity supplies). These enabling factors include flexible decision making, inclusive management, and support in motivating frontline staff who can work with agency as a team. Improved software, even within constrained hardware (especially in low-income and middle-income countries), can directly contribute to improved {SRH} and {HIV} service delivery. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Malaria in pregnancy ({MiP}) is an important public health problem across sub-Saharan Africa. The package of measures for its control in Ghana in the last 20 years include regular use of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets ({LLINs}), directly-observed administration ({DOT}) of intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ({IPTp}-{SP}) and prompt and effective case management of {MiP}. Unfortunately, Ghana like other sub-Saharan African countries did not achieve the reset Abuja targets of 100\% of pregnant women having access to {IPTp} and 100\% using {LLINs} by 2015. Methods: This ethnographic study explored how healthcare managers dealt with existing {MiP} policy implementation challenges and the consequences on {IPTp}-{SP} uptake and access to maternal healthcare. The study collected date using non-participant observations, conversations, in-depth interviews and case studies in eight health facilities and 12 communities for 12 months in two Administrative regions in Ghana. Results: Healthcare managers addressed frequent stock-outs of malaria programme drugs and supplies from the National Malaria Control Programme and delayed reimbursement from the {NHIS}, by instituting co-payment, rationing and prescribing drugs for women to buy from private pharmacies. This ensured that facilities had funds to pay creditors, purchase drugs and supplies for health service delivery. However, it affected their ability to enforce {DOT} and to monitor adherence to treatment. Women who could afford maternal healthcare and {MiP} services and those who had previously benefitted from such services were happy to access uninterrupted services. Women who could not maternal healthcare services resorted to visiting other sources of health care, delaying {ANC} and skipping scheduled {ANC} visits. Consequently, some clients did not receive the recommended 5 + doses of {SP}, others did not obtain {LLINs} early and some did not obtain treatment for {MiP}. Healthcare providers felt frustrated whenever they could not provide comprehensive care to women who could not afford comprehensive maternal and {MiP} care. Conclusion: For Ghana to achieve her goal of controlling {MiP}, the Ministry of Health and other supporting institutions need to ensure prompt reimbursement of funds, regular supply of programme drugs and medical supplies to public, faith-based and private health facilities.  © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Several evaluative studies demonstrate that a well-coordinated Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses ({IMCI}) program can reduce child mortality. However, there is dearth of information on how frontline providers perceive {IMCI} and how, in their view, the program is implemented and how it could be refined and revitalized. Purpose: To determine the key challenges affecting {IMCI} implementation from the perspective of health care workers ({HCWs}) in primary health care facilities. Methods: A scoping review based on the five-step framework of Arskey and O’Malley was utilized to identify key challenges faced by {HCWs} implementing the {IMCI} program in primary health care facilities. A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed literature through {PubMed}, {ScienceDirect}, {EBSCOhost} and Google Scholar was conducted. A total of 1,475 publications were screened for eligibility and 41 publications identified for full-text evaluation. Twenty-four (24) published articles met our inclusion criteria, and were investigated to tease out common themes related to challenges of {HCWs} in terms of implementing the {IMCI} program. Results: Four key challenges emerged from our analysis: 1) Insufficient financial resources to fund program activities, 2) Lack of training, mentoring and supervision from the tertiary level, 3) Length of time required for effective and meaningful {IMCI} consultations conflicts with competing demands and 4) Lack of planning and coordination between policy makers and implementers resulting in ambiguity of roles and accountability. Although the {IMCI} program can provide substantial benefits, more information is still needed regarding implementation processes and acceptability in primary health care settings. Conclusion: Recognizing and understanding insights of those enacting health programs such as {IMCI} can spark meaningful strategic recommendations to improve {IMCI} program effectiveness. This review suggests four domains that merit consideration in the context of efforts to scale and expand {IMCI} programs. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Nevertheless, there is a paucity of detailed analytical information about the processes and factors driving unprecedented urban growth in the period following the genocide perpetrated against the Tutsi (1994) and its impact on the natural environment. This article, therefore, analyses the growth of the city of Kigali with respect to its post-genocide spatial and demographic dimensions. The methodology involves a quantification of urban growth over the period of the last 30 years using remote-sensing imagery coupled with demographic data drawn from different sources. The analysis of land cover trends shows how significant the pressure of urban expansion has been on the natural environment, with a 14 per cent decrease in open land between 1999 and 2018. Spatially, the average annual growth rate was almost 10.24 per cent during the same period. This growth is associated with the building of a large number of institutions, schools and industries. Moreover, the increase in low-income residents led to the construction of bungalows expanding on large suburbs and the development of new sub-centres in the periphery instead of high-rise apartments. © 2021 National Institute of Urban Affairs.},

	abstract = {Background: Ethiopia has made a significant progress of malaria control. Currently, the country has adopted and is implementing the World Health Organization very ambitious, but achievable, malaria elimination plan through extensive efforts. The regular evaluation of its performance is vital for plausible improvement. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the trends of malaria infection in Boricha district, Southern Ethiopia. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in all health facilities of the district. All malaria cases registered during 2010 to 2017 were reviewed to determine the trends of malaria morbidity. {EpiData} 3.1 was used for data entry and data were analysed using {SPSS} version 20.0. Results: A total of 135,607 malaria suspects were diagnosed using microscopy and rapid diagnostic test over the last 8 years, of which 29,554 (21.8\%) were confirmed positive cases. Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and mixed infections (both species) accounted for 56.3\%, 38.4\% and 5.2\% of cases, respectively. Except in 2013 and 2014, Plasmodium falciparum was the dominant species over P. vivax. Of the total confirmed cases 51.6\% were adults (≥ 15 years) followed by 24.5\% of 5-14 years, and 23.9\% of under 5 years. In general, malaria morbidity was significantly reduced over the last 8 years. The positivity rate declined from 54.6\% to 5\% during 2010 to 2017, and the case incidence rate per 1000 population at risk also declined from 18.9 to 2.2 during the same period. Malaria was reported in all months of the year, with peaks in November, followed by September and July. Malaria transmission has strong association with season (x2 = 303.955, df = 22, p {\textless} 0.0001). Conclusion: In general, a significant reduction of malaria morbidity was observed over the past 8 years. However, further investigation using advanced diagnostic tools is vital to determine the level of sub-microscopic infections to guide the elimination plan. In addition, eco-epidemiological analysis at fine-scale level is essential to devise area-specific interventions. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: An increase in the uptake of skilled birth attendance is expected to reduce maternal mortality in low- and middle-income countries. In Tanzania, the proportion of deliveries assisted by a skilled birth attendant is only 64\% and the maternal mortality ratio is still 398/100.000 live births. This article explores different aspects of quality of care and respectful care in relation to maternal healthcare. It then examines the influence of these aspects of care on the uptake of skilled birth attendance in Tanzania in order to offer recommendations on how to increase the skilled birth attendance rate. Methods: This narrative review employed the “person-centered care framework for reproductive health equity” as outlined by Sudhinaraset (2017). Academic databases, search engines and websites were consulted, and snowball sampling was used. Full-text English articles from the last 10 years were included. Results: Uptake of skilled birth attendance was influenced by different aspects of technical quality of maternal care as well as person-centred care, and these factors were interrelated. For example, disrespectful care was linked to factors which made the working circumstances of healthcare providers more difficult such as resource shortages, low levels of integrated care, inadequate referral systems, and bad management. These issues disproportionately affected rural facilities. However, disrespectful care could sometimes be attributed to personal attitudes and discrimination on the part of healthcare providers. Dissatisfied patients responded with either quiet acceptance of the circumstances, by delivering at home with a traditional birth attendant, or bypassing to other facilities. Best practices to increase respectful care show that multi-component interventions are needed on birth preparedness, attitude and infrastructure improvement, and birth companionship, with strong management and accountability at all levels. Conclusions: To further increase the uptake of skilled birth attendance, respectful care needs to be addressed within strategic plans. Multi-component interventions are required, with multi-stakeholder involvement. Participation of traditional birth attendants in counselling and referral can be considered. Future advances in information and communication technology might support improved quality of care. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Methods: All available health systems data relevant for malaria control were collated from 23 online data repositories. Principal component analysis was used to create domain specific health system performance measures. Multiple regression model selection approaches were used to identify key health systems predictors of progress in malaria control in the 2000-2016 period among 105 countries. Additional analysis was performed within malaria burden groups. Results: There was large heterogeneity in progress in malaria control in the 2000-2016 period. In univariate analysis, several health systems factors displayed a strong positive correlation with reductions in malaria burden between 2000 and 2016. In multivariable models, delivery of routine services and hospital capacity were strongly predictive of reductions in malaria cases, especially in high burden countries. In low-burden countries approaching elimination, primary health center density appeared negatively associated with progress while hospital capacity was positively correlated with eliminating malaria. Conclusions: The findings presented in this manuscript suggest that strengthening health systems can be an effective strategy for reducing malaria cases, especially in countries with high malaria burden. Potential returns appear particularly high in the area of service delivery. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In 2011, the South African National {TB} Programme launched a policy of decentralized management of drug-resistant tuberculosis ({DR}-{TB}) in order to expand the capacity of facilities to treat patients with {DR}-{TB}, minimize delays to access care and improve patient outcomes. This policy directive was implemented to varying degrees within a rapidly evolving diagnostic and treatment landscape for {DR}-{TB}, placing new demands on already-stressed health systems. The variable readiness of district-level systems to implement the policy prompted questions not only about differences in health systems resources but also front-line actors' capacity to implement change in resource-constrained facilities. Using a grounded theory approach, we analysed data from in-depth interviews and small group discussions conducted between 2016 and 2018 with managers (n = 9), co-ordinators (n = 15), doctors (n = 7) and nurses (n = 18) providing {DR}-{TB} care. Data were collected over two phases in district-level decentralized sites of three South African provinces. While health systems readiness assessments conventionally map the availability of 'hardware', i.e. resources and skills to deliver an intervention, a notable absence of systems 'hardware' meant that systems 'software', i.e. health care workers ({HCWs}) agency, behaviours and interactions provided the basis of locally relevant strategies for decentralized {DR}-{TB} care. 'Software readiness' was manifest in four areas of {DR}-{TB} care: re-organization of service delivery, redressal of resource shortages, creation of treatment adherence support systems and extension of care parameters for vulnerable patients. These strategies demonstrate adaptive capacity and everyday resilience among {HCW} to withstand the demands of policy change and innovation in stressed systems. Our work suggests that a useful extension of health systems 'readiness' assessments would include definition and evaluation of {HCW} 'software' and adaptive capacities in the face of systems hardware gaps.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {Background: Emergency care ({EC}) describes team-based, multidisciplinary clinical service provision, advocacy and health systems strengthening to address all urgent aspects of illness and injury for all people. In order to improve facility-based {EC} delivery, a structured framework is necessary to outline current capacity and future needs. This paper draws on examples of {EC} Needs Assessments performed at the national hospitals of three different Pacific Island Countries ({PICs}), to describe the development, implementation and validation of a structured assessment tool and methodological approach to conducting an {EC} Needs Assessment in the Pacific region. Methods: This is a retrospective, descriptive analysis of the development of the Pacific Emergency Care Assessment ({PECA}) table using patient-focused principles within an {EC} systems framework. Tool implementation occurred through observation, literature review and interviews using a strengths-based, action-research and ethnographic methodological approach in Timor-Leste, Kiribati and the Solomon Islands. The 2014 Solomon Islands {EC} Needs Assessment provides the main context to illustrate and discuss the overall conduct, feasibility, validity and reliability of the {PECA} tool and methodological approach. Results: In each site, the methodological implementation enabled completion of both the {PECA} table and comprehensive report within approximately 6 weeks of first arriving in country. Reports synthesising findings, recommendations, priority action areas and strategies were distributed widely amongst stakeholders. Examples illustrate Face and Content, Construct and Catalytic validity, including subsequent process and infrastructure improvements triggered by the {EC} Needs Assessment in each site. Triangulation of information and consistency of use over time enhanced reliability of the {PECA} tool. Compared to other {EC} assessment models, the Pacific approach enabled rich data on capacity and real-life function of {EC} facilities. The qualitative, strengths-based method engenders long-term partnerships and positive action, but takes time and requires tailoring to a specific site. Conclusion: In {PICs} and other global contexts where {EC} resources are underdeveloped, a {PECA}-style approach to conducting an {EC} Needs Assessment can trigger positive change through high local stakeholder engagement. Testing this qualitative implementation method with a standardised {EC} assessment tool in other limited resource contexts is the next step to further improve global {EC}. © 2020 The Author(s).},

This study aimed to estimate the financial resources required to implement the Ethiopian {EHSP} from 2020 to 2030. Furthermore, we explored potential alternatives to increase the fiscal space for health in Ethiopia. We used the {OneHealth} Tool ({OHT}) to estimate the costs of expanding the {EHSP} service provision in the public sector in Ethiopia. Combinations of ingredient-based bottom-up and program-based summary costing approaches were applied. We predicted the fiscal space using assumptions for economic growth, government resource allocations to health, external aid for health, the magnitude of out-of-pocket expenditure, and other private health expenditures as critical factors affecting available resources devoted to health. All costs were valued using 2020 {US} dollars ({USD}). To implement the {EHSP}, 13.0 billion {USD} (per capita: 94 {USD}) would be required in 2030. The largest (50–70\%) share of estimated costs was for medicines, commodities, and supplies, followed by human resources costs (10–17\%). However, the expected available resources based on a business-as-usual fiscal space estimate would be 63 {USD} per capita for the same year. Therefore, the gap as a percentage of the required resources would be 33\% in 2030. The resources needed to implement the {EHSP} would increase steadily over the projection period due mainly to increases in service coverage targets over time. Allocating gains from economic growth to increase the total government health expenditure could partly address the gap. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: {HIV} testing remains low among adolescents. Making public health services more adolescent-friendly is one strategy used to encourage testing. However, it remains unclear whether government-led initiatives have a meaningfully impact. Methods: The current study is observational and utilizes two sources of data (health-facility and adolescent-level) from one round of data collection of an on-going, longitudinal impact evaluation of a pilot cash plus program targeting adolescents. This study linked data from adolescent surveys (n = 2191) to data collected from nearby government-run health facilities (n = 91) in two rural regions of Tanzania. We used log binomial regression models to estimate the association between specific adolescent-friendly health service ({AFHS}) characteristics and adolescents' uptake of 1) {HIV} testing and 2) visiting a health care facility in the past year for sexual and reproductive health ({SRH}) services. Results: Most adolescents (67\%) lived in a village with a health facility, and all offered {HIV} services. We find, however, that {AFHS} have not been fully implemented. For example, less than 40\% of facilities reported that they had guidelines for adolescent care. Only 12\% of facilities had a system in place for referral and follow-up with adolescent clients, yet this was an important predictor of both past-year {HIV} testing ({RR} = 1.28, p {\textless} 0.1) and {SRH} visits ({RR} = 1.44, p {\textless} 0.05). Less than half (44\%) offered services for survivors of gender-based violence ({GBV}), a significant predictor of past-year {HIV} testing ({RR} = 1.20, p {\textless} 0.05) and {SRH} visits ({RR} = 1.41, p {\textless} 0.01) among sexually-active adolescents. Conclusions: We find that national guidelines on {AFHS} have not been fully translated into practice at the local level. We highlight particular gaps in adolescent referral systems and {GBV} services. Scaling up these two essential services could encourage greater {HIV} testing among a high-risk population, in addition to providing much needed support for survivors of violence. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Sub-Saharan African ({SSA}) countries’ health systems are often vulnerable to unplanned situations that can hinder their effectiveness in terms of data completeness and disease control. For instance, in Burkina Faso following a workers' strike, comprehensive data on several diseases were unavailable for a long period in 2019. Weather, seasonal-malaria-chemoprevention ({SMC}), free healthcare, and other contextual data, which are purported to influence malarial disease, provide opportunities to fit models to describe the clinical malaria data and predict the disease spread. Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling was applied to weekly malaria surveillance data from Burkina Faso (2011–2018) while considering the effects of weather, health programs and contextual factors. Then, a prediction was used to deal with weekly missing data for the entire year of 2019, and {SMC} and free healthcare effects were quantified. Our proposed model accurately predicted weekly clinical malaria incidence (correlation coefficient, r = 0.90). The distribution of clinical malaria incidence was heterogeneous across the country. Overall, national predicted clinical malaria incidence in 2019 (605 per 1000 [95\% {CrI}: 360–990]) increased by 24.7\% compared with the year 2015. {SMC} and the interaction between free healthcare and health facility attendance were associated with a reduction in clinical malaria incidence. Our modeling approach could be a useful tool for strengthening health systems’ resilience by addressing data completeness and could support {SSA} countries in developing appropriate targets and indicators to facilitate the subnational control effort. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: The Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illness ({IMNCI}) strategy includes both preventive and curative interventions to improve practices in health facilities, the health system and at home. The quality of these interventions has been very rarely subjected to scientific inquiry in Ethiopia. This study assessed quality of {IMNCI} services in health centers of Jimma, South West Ethiopia, 2014. Methods: A facility based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2–15, 2014 in the health centers of Jimma among 411 care takers exit interview and total of 60 consultation sessions were observed using checklist and participants enrolled through convenient sampling technique. Descriptive statistics were used and factor analysis was employed to create measurement scales for satisfaction of caretakers. Factor scores were used in linear regres-sion analyses to determine presence of statistically significant association between explana-tory variables and the outcome variable at P value {\textless}0.05. Results: The response rate for the exit interview was 411 (97.4\%). The mean score of overall caretakers satisfaction was 63.4. Specifically 23.4\%, 33.6\%, and 19.2\% of the respondents were dissatisfied with waiting time, amount of explanation they received about the problem or treatment, and availability of medicines, respectively. Availability of prescribed medications (95\% {CI}: 0.577 to 0.047), receiving first dose of medication at health facility (95\% {CI}: 0.087, 0.552), receiving laboratory services (95\% {CI}:0.455,0.056) were among factors that significantly associated with the caretakers’ satisfaction score. Conclusion and Recommendations: Perceived mean of caretakers’ satisfaction at the health centers of Jimma town was low as compared to national standards and long waiting time while providing services. Availability of prescribed medications, receiving first dose of medication and receiving laboratory services were factors associated with patients’ satisfac-tion. Respective health centers need to ensure availability of medications and supplies and professionals need to pay special attention on medical services like laboratory services, medication and decrease waiting time while providing health services. © 2021 Ketero et al.},

	abstract = {Community participation in health care delivery will ensure service availability and accessibility and guarantee community ownership of the program. Community-based strategies such as the involvement of Community Health Volunteers ({CHVs}) and Community Health Management Committees ({CHMCs}) are likely to advance primary healthcare in general, but the criteria for selecting {CHVs}, {CHMCs} and efforts to sustain these roles are not clear 20 years after implementing the Community-based Health Planning Services program. We examined the process of selecting these cadres of community health workers and their current role within Ghana’s flagship program for primary care–the Community-based Health Planning and Services program. Methods This was an exploratory study design using qualitative methods to appraise the health system and stakeholder participation in Community-based Health Planning and Services program implementation in the Upper East region of Ghana. We conducted 51 in-depth interviews and 33 focus group discussions with health professionals and community members. Results Community Health Volunteers and Community Health Management Committees are the representatives of the community in the routine implementation of the Community-based Health Planning and Services program. They are selected, appointed, or nominated by their communities. Some inherit the position through apprenticeship and others are recruited through advertisement. The selection is mostly initiated by the health providers and carried out by community members. Community Health Volunteers lead community mobilization efforts, support health providers in health promotion activities, manage minor illnesses, and encourage pregnant women to use maternal health services. Community Health Volunteers also translate health messages delivered by health providers to the people in their local languages. Community Health Management Committees mobilize resources for the development of Community-based Health Planning and Services program compounds. They play a mediatory role between health providers in the health compounds and the community members. Volunteers are sometimes given non-financial incentives but there are suggestions to include financial incentives. Conclusion Community Health Volunteers and Community Health Management Committees play a critical role in primary health care. The criteria for selecting Community Health Volunteers and Community Health Management Committees vary but need to be standardized to ensure that only self-motivated individuals are selected. Thus, {CHVs} and {CHMCs} should contest for their positions and be endorsed by their community members and assigned roles by health professionals in the {CHPS} zones. Efforts to sustain them within the health system should include the provision of financial incentives. Copyright: © 2021 Sakeah et al.

	abstract = {Background Understanding the perceptions of quality of care given to sick young infants in primary healthcare settings is key for developing strategies for effective uptake and utilisation of possible severe bacterial infection guidelines. The purpose of this study is to assess families and providers' perceptions of care given to sick young infants at primary healthcare facilities in four diverse counties in Kenya. Methods A cross-sectional qualitative design involving 37 in-depth interviews and 39 focus group discussions with very young (15-18 years), young (19-24 years) and older (25-45 years) caregivers of young infants aged 0-59 days; and key informant interviews with community-based and facility-based front-line health providers (14) in primary healthcare facilities. Qualitative data were captured using audio tapes and field notes, transcribed, translated and exported into {QSR} {NVivo} V.12 for analysis. A thematic framework approach was adopted to classify and analyse data. Results Perceived care given to sick young infants was described around six domains of the {WHO} framework for the quality of maternal and newborn healthcare: evidence-based practices for routine and emergency care; functional referral systems; effective communication; respect and preservation of dignity; availability of competent, motivated human resources; and availability of physical resources. Views of caregivers and providers regarding sick young infant care in primary healthcare settings were similar across the four sites. Main hindrance to sick young infant care includes stockout of essential drugs, limited infrastructure, lack of functional referral system, inadequate providers which led to delays in receiving treatment, inadequate provider skills and poor provider attitudes. Despite these challenges, motivation and teamwork of health providers were key tenets in care provision. Conclusion The findings underscore the need to prioritise improving quality of sick young infant services at primary healthcare settings by building capacity of providers through training, ensuring continuous supply of essential medicines and equipment and improving infrastructure including referral.  © 2021 {BMJ} Publishing Group.

	abstract = {Tuberculosis ({TB}) remains to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Early {TB} case detection ({TCD}) and treatment of infectious cases is vital to reduce the {TB} burden. The objective of this study was to identify possible barriers to {TCD} in East Gojjam Zone, northwest Ethiopia. The study used a descriptive phenomenological research method. The study participants included 21 {TB} patients, six {TB} control officers, and 40 health workers ({HWs}) selected by a heterogeneous purposive sampling technique. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were used to collect data. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, translated, and thematically analyzed using {NVivo} 12 software (developed by {QSR} International Qualitative Software Developer, Melbourne, Australia). The study participants identified numerous barriers to {TCD} which were grouped into three major themes and 14 subthemes: 1) patient-related barriers including rural residence, low income, poor health literacy, and health-seeking delay; 2) healthcare system barriers grouped into two subthemes: {HWs} barriers (shortage of {HWs}, lack of training access, and low level of knowledge and skills) and health facility barriers (health service delay, using only passive {TCD} strategy, poor health education provision, and lack of regular supervision and timely feedback); 3) sociocultural and environmental barriers which included stigma and discrimination, lack of health information sources, poor transportation infrastructure, and community resistance. In conclusion, the {TCD} activity which is one of the pillars of the {TB} control program has been confronted with several patient-related, environmental, and healthcare system-related barriers. Improving community health literacy, scale-up access, and improving quality of {TB} diagnostic services, conducting regular supportive supervision and provision of timely feedback, arranging regular refresher training and staff motivation and recruitment schemes, and engaging local health officials and political leaders to address budgetary problems for {TB} and transportation infrastructure challenges are imperative interventions to enhance the {TCD} efforts in the study area.

	abstract = {Background {COVID}-19 has caused a global public health crisis affecting most countries, including Ethiopia, in various ways. This study maps the vulnerability to infection, case severity and likelihood of death from {COVID}-19 in Ethiopia. Methods Thirty-eight potential indicators of vulnerability to {COVID}-19 infection, case severity and likelihood of death, identified based on a literature review and the availability of nationally representative data at a low geographic scale, were assembled from multiple sources for geospatial analysis. Geospatial analysis techniques were applied to produce maps showing the vulnerability to infection, case severity and likelihood of death in Ethiopia at a spatial resolution of 1 km×1 km. Results This study showed that vulnerability to {COVID}-19 infection is likely to be high across most parts of Ethiopia, particularly in the Somali, Afar, Amhara, Oromia and Tigray regions. The number of severe cases of {COVID}-19 infection requiring hospitalisation and intensive care unit admission is likely to be high across Amhara, most parts of Oromia and some parts of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region. The risk of {COVID}-19-related death is high in the country's border regions, where public health preparedness for responding to {COVID}-19 is limited.

	abstract = {Background: Nepal has made significant strides in maternal and neonatal mortality over the last three decades. However, poor quality of care can threaten the gains, as maternal and newborn services are particularly sensitive to quality of care. Our study aimed to understand current gaps in the process and the outcome dimensions of the quality of antenatal care ({ANC}), particularly at the sub-national level. We assessed these dimensions of the quality of {ANC} in 17 primary, public hospitals across Nepal. We also assessed the variation in the {ANC} process across the patients' socio-economic gradient. Methods: We used a convergent mixed methods approach, whereby we triangulated qualitative and quantitative data. In the quantitative component, we observed interactions between providers (17 hospitals from all 7 provinces) and 198 women seeking {ANC} and recorded the tasks the providers performed, using the Service Provision Assessments protocol available from the Demographic and Health Survey program. The main outcome variable was the number of tasks performed by the provider during an {ANC} consultation. The tasks ranged from identifying potential signs of danger to providing counseling. We analyzed the resulting data descriptively and assessed the relationship between the number of tasks performed and users' characteristics. In the qualitative component, we synthesized users' and providers' narratives on perceptions of the overall quality of care obtained through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. Results: Out of the 59 tasks recommended by the World Health Organization, providers performed only 22 tasks (37.3\%) on average. The number of tasks performed varied significantly across provinces, with users in province 3 receiving significantly higher quality care than those in other provinces. Educated women were treated better than those with no education. Users and providers agreed that the overall quality of care was inadequate, although providers mentioned that the current quality was the best they could provide given the constraints they faced. Conclusion: The quality of {ANC} in Nepal's primary hospitals is poor and inequitable across education and geographic gradients. While current efforts, such as the provision of 24/7 birthing centers, can mitigate gaps in service availability, additional equipment, infrastructure and human resources will be needed to improve quality. Providers also need additional training focused on treating patients from different backgrounds equally. Our study also points to the need for additional research, both to document the quality of care more objectively and to establish key determinants of quality to inform policy. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {Background: As technology has become cheaper and more accessible, health programs are adopting digital health interventions ({DHI}) to improve the provision of and demand for health services. These interventions are complex and require strong coordination and support across different health system levels and government departments, and they need significant capacities in technology and information to be properly implemented. Electronic immunization registries ({EIRs}) are types of {DHI} used to capture, store, access, and share individual-level, longitudinal health information in digitized records. The {BID} Initiative worked in partnership with the governments of Tanzania and Zambia to introduce an {EIR} at the sub-national level in both countries within 5 years as part of a multi-component complex intervention package focusing on data use capacity-building. Methods: We aimed to gather and describe learnings from the {BID} experience by conducting a framework-based mixed methods study to describe perceptions of factors that influenced scale-up of the {EIR}. Data were collected through key informant interviews, a desk review, {EIRs}, and health management information systems. We described how implementation of the {EIRs} fulfilled domains described in our conceptual framework and used cases to illustrate the relationships and relative influence of domains for scale-up and adoption of the {EIR}. Results: We found that there was no single factor that seemed to influence the introduction or sustained adoption of the {EIR} as many of the factors were interrelated. For {EIR} introduction, strong strategic engagement among partners was important, while {EIR} adoption was influenced by adequate staffing at facilities, training, use of data for supervision, internet and electricity connectivity, and community sensitization. Conclusions: Organizations deploying {DHIs} in the future should consider how best to adapt their intervention to the existing ecosystem, including human resources and organizational capacity, as well as the changing technological landscape during planning and implementation. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objectives of this study were: (1) to examine gender differences in biomedical indicators, lifestyle behaviors, self‐health check practices, receipt of professional non‐communicable disease ({NCD})‐related lifestyle advice, and the use of health services among teachers in Afghanistan; and (2) to seek the patterns of these indicators among users and non‐users of health services among both male and female teachers. This cross‐sectional study was carried out among 600 schoolteachers in Kabul city in February 2017. Gender differences in percentage distributions of abnormal biomedical indicators, lifestyle behaviors, self‐health check practices, and receipt of professional lifestyle advice were examined. These patterns were further analyzed according to the use of health services in the previous 12 months by both genders. The results showed that male teachers had a higher prevalence of hypertension, increased serum triglycerides, physically active lifestyle, and tobacco use than female teachers (28.2/20.4, p = 0.038; 47.0/37.9, p = 0.040; 54.3/40.9, p = 0.002; 15.8/0.7, p {\textless} 0.001, respectively); female teachers had a higher prevalence of increased serum {LDL} cholesterol, overweight/obesity, and frequent consumption of fruits/vegetables than male teachers (61.3/50.8, p = 0.018; 64.7/43.5, p {\textless} 0.001; 71.4/53.8, p {\textless} 0.001, respectively). Female teachers were more likely to receive professional lifestyle advice related to {NCDs} than male teachers. Although users of health services practiced self‐health checks and received professional lifestyle advice more frequently than non‐users, abnormal biomedical indicators were similarly shown among users and non‐users of health services in both genders. In conclusion, high prevalence of abnormal biomedical indicators was indicated in both male and female teachers, although the specific abnormal biomedical indicators differed by gender. Users and non‐users of health services presented a similar prevalence of these abnormal indicators. Understanding the differences in patterns of {NCD} risk factors is essential when developing gender‐informed policies. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee {MDPI}, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Background Although much has been documented about the performance of the health extension program, there is a lack of information on how efficiently the program is running. Furthermore, the rising cost of health services and the absence of competition among publicly owned health facilities demands strong follow up of efficiency. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the technical efficiency of the health posts and determinants in Southwestern Ethiopia. Methods and materials We used data for one Ethiopian fiscal year (from July 2016 to June 2017) to estimate the technical efficiency of health posts. A total of 66 health posts were included in the analysis. We employed a two-stage data envelopment analysis to estimate technical efficiency. At the first stage, technical efficiency scores were calculated using data envelopment analysis program version 2.1. Predictors of technical efficiency were then identified at the second stage using Tobit regression, with {STATA} version 14. Results The findings revealed that 21.2\% were technically efficient with a mean technical efficiency score of 0.6 (± 0.3), indicating that health posts could increase their service volume by 36\% with no change made to the inputs they received. On the other hand, health posts had an average scale efficiency score of 0.8 (± 0.2) implying that the facilities have the potential to increase service volume by 16\% with the existing resources. The regression model has indicated average waiting time for service has negatively affected technical efficiency. Conclusion More than three-quarters of health posts were found inefficient. The technical efficiency score of more than one-third of the health posts is even less than 50\%. Community mobilization to enhance the uptake of health services at the health posts coupled with a possible reallocation of resources in less efficient health posts is a possible approach to improve the efficiency of the program. © 2021 Yitbarek et al.

	abstract = {Placement of pathology and laboratory medicine ({PALM}) services requires balancing efficiency (maximizing test volume) with equitable urban-rural access. We compared the association between population density (proxy for efficiency) and travel time to the closest facility (proxy for equitable access) across levels of Tanzania's public sector health system. We linked geospatial data for Tanzania from multiple sources. Data on facility locations and other geographic measures were collected from government and non-governmental databases. We classified facilities assuming increasing {PALM} availability by tier: (1) dispensaries, (2) health centres, (3) district hospitals and (4) regional/referral hospitals. We used the {AccessMod} 5 algorithm to estimate travel time to the closest facility for each tier across Tanzania with 500-m resolution. District-level average population density and travel time to the closest facility were calculated and presented using medians and interquartile ranges. Spatial correlations between these variables were estimated using the global Moran's I and bivariate Local Indicator of Spatial Autocorrelation, specifying a queen's neighbourhood matrix. Spatial analysis was restricted to 171 contiguous districts. The study included 5406 dispensaries, 675 health centres, 186 district hospitals and 37 regional/referral hospitals. District-level travel times were shortest for Tier 1 (median: [{IQR}]: 45.4 min [30.0-74.7]) and longest for Tier 4 facilities (160.2 min [107.3-260.0]). There was a weak spatial autocorrelation across tiers (Tier 1: -0.289, Tier 2: -0.292, Tier 3: -0.271 and Tier 4: -0.258) and few districts were classified as significant spatial outliers. Across tiers, geographic patterns of populated districts surrounded by neighbours with short travel time and sparsely populated districts surrounded by neighbours with long travel time were observed. Similar spatial correlation measures across health system levels suggest that Tanzania's health system reflects equitable urban-rural access to different {PALM} services. Longer travel times to hospital-based care could be ameliorated by shifting specialized diagnostics to more accessible lower tiers.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {A previous study in Ethiopia reported significant variation in rotavirus vaccine uptake across socioeconomic strata. This study aims to quantify socioeconomic inequality of rotavirus vaccine uptake in Ethiopia and to identify the contributing factors for the inequality. The concentration curve ({CC}) and the Erreygers Normalized Concentration Index ({ECI}) were used to assess the socioeconomic related inequality in rotavirus vaccine uptake using data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey. Decomposition analysis was conducted to identify the drivers of inequalities. The {CC} for rotavirus vaccine uptake lay below the line of equality and the {ECI} was 0.270 (p {\textless} 0.001) indicating that uptake of rotavirus vaccine in Ethiopia was significantly concentrated among children from families with better socioeconomic status. The decomposition analysis showed that underlining inequalities in maternal health care services utilization, including antenatal care use (18.4\%) and institutional delivery (8.1\%), exposure to media (12.8\%), and maternal educational level (9.7\%) were responsible for the majority of observed inequalities in the uptake of rotavirus vaccine. The findings suggested that there is significant socioeconomic inequality in rotavirus vaccine uptake in Ethiopia. Multi-sectoral actions are required to reduce the inequalities, inclusive increasing maternal health care services, and educational attainments among economically disadvantaged mothers. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {In recent decades, bold steps taken by the government of Nepal to liberalise its abortion law and increase the affordability and accessibility of safe abortion and family planning have contributed to significant improvements in maternal mortality and other sexual and reproductive health ({SRH}) outcomes. The Trump administration’s Global Gag Rule ({GGR})–which prohibits foreign non-governmental organisations ({NGOs}) from receiving {US} global health assistance unless they certify that they will not use funding from any source to engage in service delivery, counselling, referral, or advocacy related to abortion–threatens this progress. This paper examines the impact of the {GGR} on civil society, {NGOs}, and {SRH} service delivery in Nepal. We conducted 205 semi-structured in-depth interviews in 2 phases (August–September 2018, and June–September 2019), and across 22 districts. Interview participants included {NGO} programme managers, government employees, facility managers and service providers in the {NGO} and private sectors, and service providers in public sector facilities. This large, two-phased study complements existing anecdotal research by capturing impacts of the {GGR} as they evolved over the course of a year, and by surfacing pathways through which this policy affects {SRH} outcomes. We found that low policy awareness and a considerable chilling effect cut across levels of the Nepali health system and exacerbated impacts caused by routine implementation of the {GGR}, undermining the ecology of {SRH} service delivery in Nepal as well as national sovereignty. © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: The provision of eye care services is currently insufficient to meet the requirements of eye care. Many people remain unnecessarily visually impaired or at risk of becoming so because of treatable or preventable eye conditions. A lack of access and awareness of services is, in large part, a key barrier to handle this unmet need. Objective: This study aimed to assess whether utilizing novel smartphone-based clinical algorithms can task-shift eye screening to community volunteers ({CVs}) to accurately identify and refer patients to primary eye care services. In particular, we developed the Peek Community Screening app and assessed its validity in making referral decisions for patients with eye problems. Methods: We developed a smartphone-based clinical algorithm (the Peek Community Screening app) using age, distance vision, near vision, and pain as referral criteria. We then compared {CVs}'referral decisions using this app with those made by an experienced ophthalmic clinical officer ({OCO}), which was the reference standard. The same participants were assessed by a trained {CV} using the app and by an {OCO} using standard outreach equipment. The outcome was the proportion of all decisions that were correct when compared with that of the {OCO}. Results: The required sensitivity and specificity for the Peek Community Screening app were achieved after seven iterations. In the seventh iteration, the {OCO} identified referable eye problems in 65.9\% (378/574) of the participants. {CVs} correctly identified 344 of 378 (sensitivity 91.0\%; 95\% {CI} 87.7\%-93.7\%) of the cases and correctly identified 153 of 196 (specificity 78.1\%; 95\% {CI} 71.6\%-83.6\%) cases as not having a referable eye problem. The positive predictive value was 88.9\% (95\% {CI} 85.3\%-91.8\%), and the negative predictive value was 81.8\% (95\% {CI} 75.5\%-87.1\%). Conclusions: Development of such an algorithm is feasible; however, it requires considerable effort and resources. {CVs} can accurately use the Peek Community Screening app to identify and refer people with eye problems. An iterative design process is necessary to ensure validity in the local context. © 2020 {JMIR} Publications. All rights reserved.},

The {UN} and {WHO} encourage countries to make health facility location data open, to encourage use and improvement. We provide a summary of open access health facility location data in Africa using re-useable R code. We aim to support data analysts developing software tools to address {COVID}-19 response in individual countries. In Africa there are currently three main sources of such open data; 1) direct from national ministries of health, 2) a database for sub-Saharan Africa collated and published by a team from {KEMRI}-Wellcome Trust Research Programme and now hosted by {WHO}, and 3) The Global Healthsites Mapping Project in collaboration with {OpenStreetMap}. Methods: We searched for and documented official national facility location data that were openly available. We developed re-useable open-source R code to summarise and visualise facility location data by country from the three sources. This re-useable code is used to provide a web user interface allowing data exploration through maps and plots of facility type. Results: Out of 52 African countries, seven currently provide an official open facility list that can be downloaded and analysed reproducibly. Considering all three sources, there are over 185,000 health facility locations available for Africa. However, there are differences and overlaps between sources and a lack of data on capacities and service provision. Conclusions: These summaries and software tools can be used to encourage greater use of existing health facility location data, incentivise further improvements in the provision of those data by national suppliers, and encourage collaboration within wider data communities. The tools are a part of the afrimapr project, actively developing R building blocks to facilitate the use of health data in Africa. © 2021. South A et al.},

	abstract = {Background Efforts to expand access to institutional delivery alone without quality of care do not guarantee better survival. However, little evidence documents the quality of childbirth care in Ethiopia, which limits our ability to improve quality. Therefore, this study assessed the quality of and barriers to routine childbirth care signal functions during intra-partum and immediate postpartum period. Methods A sequential explanatory mixed method study was conducted among 225 skilled birth attendants who attended 876 recently delivered women in primary level facilities. A multi stage sampling procedure was used for the quantitative phase whilst purposive sampling was used for the qualitative phase. The quantitative survey recruitment occurred in July to August 2018 and in April 2019 for the qualitative key informant interview and Focus Group Discussions ({FGD}). A validated quantitative tool from a previous validated measurement study was used to collect quantitative data, whereas an interview guide, informed by the literature and quantitative findings, was used to collect the qualitative data. Principal component analysis and a series of univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis were used to analyze the quantitative data. For the qualitative data, verbatim review of the data was iteratively followed by content analysis and triangulation with the quantitative results. Results This study showed that one out of five (20.7\%, n = 181) mothers received high quality of care in primary level facilities. Primary hospitals (β = 1.27, 95\% {CI}:0.80,1.84, p = 0.001), facilities which had staff rotation policies (β = 2.19, 95\% {CI}:0.01,4.31, p = 0.019), maternal involvement in care decisions (β = 0.92, 95\% {CI}:0.38,1.47, p = 0.001), facilities with maternal and newborn health quality improvement initiatives (β = 1.58, 95\% {CI}:0.26, 3.43, p = 0.001), compassionate respectful maternity care training (β = 0.08, 95\% {CI}: 0.07,0.88, p = 0.021), client flow for delivery (β = 0.19, 95\% {CI}:-0.34, -0.04, p = 0.012), mentorship (β = 0.02, 95\% {CI}:0.01, 0.78, p = 0.049), and providers' satisfaction (β = 0.16, 95\% {CI}:0.03, 0.29, p = 0.013) were predictors of quality of care. This is complemented by qualitative research findings that poor quality of care during delivery and immediate postpartum related to: work related burnout, gap between providers' skill and knowledge, lack of enabling working environment, poor motivation scheme and issues related to retention, poor providers caring behavior, unable translate training into practice, mismatch between number of provider and facility client flow for delivery, and in availability of essential medicine and supplies.

	abstract = {Despite an increased burden from chronic mental health conditions, access to effective mental health services in rural and remote areas is limited, and these services remain spatially undefined. We examine the spatial availability of mental health nurses across local government areas in Australia and identify gaps in mental health service delivery capacity in a finer-grained level than the state/territory data. A spatial distribution of mental health nurses was conducted. We utilized the 2017 National Health Workforce Dataset which was aggregated to {LGA} level based on the 2018 Australian Bureau Statistics ({ABS}) Data. The availability of mental health nurses was measured using the full time equivalent ({FTE}) rates per 100 000 population. We calculated the proportion of {LGAs} with zero total {FTE} rates based on remoteness categories. We also compared the mean of total {FTE} rates based on remoteness categories using analysis of variance. A spatial distribution of mental health nurses was visualized using {GIS} software for total {FTE} rates. Our analysis included 544 {LGA} across Australia, with 24.8\% being defined as remote and very remote. The mean total {FTE} for mental health nurses per 100 000 populations is 56.6 (±132.2) with a median of 17.4 ({IQR}: 61.8). A wide standard deviation reflects unequal distribution of mental health nurses across {LGAs}. The availability of total {FTE} rates for mental health nurses per 100 000 populations is significantly lower in remote and very remote {LGAs} in comparison with major cities. As many as 35.1\% of {LGAs} across Australia have no {FTE} for mental health nurses with 46\% are remote and very remote. Our study reflects the existing unequal distribution of mental health nurses between metropolitan/urban setting and rural and remote areas. We suggest three broad strategies to address these spatial inequities: improving supply and data information systems; revisiting task-shifting strategies, retraining the existing health workforce to develop skills necessary for mental health care to rural and remote communities; and incorporating the provision of mental health services within expanding innovative delivery models including consumer-led, telemedicine and community-based groups. © 2020 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.},

	abstract = {Introduction Community participation in the governance of health services is an important component in engaging stakeholders (patients, public and partners) in decision-making and related activities in health care. Community participation is assumed to contribute to quality improvement and goal attainment but remains elusive. We examined the implementation of community participation, through collaborative governance in primary health care facilities in Uasin Gishu County, Western Kenya, under the policy of devolved governance of 2013. Methods Utilizing a multiple case study methodology, five primary health care facilities were purposively selected. Study participants were individuals involved in the collaborative governance of primary health care facilities (from health service providers and community members), including in decision-making, management, oversight, service provision and problem solving. Data were collected through document review, key informant interviews and observations undertaken from 2017 to 2018. Audio recording, notetaking and a reflective journal aided data collection. Data were transcribed, cleaned, coded and analysed iteratively into emerging themes using a governance attributes framework. Findings A total of 60 participants representing individual service providers and community members participated in interviews and observations. The minutes of all meetings of five primary health care facilities were reviewed for three years (2014-2016) and eight health facility committee meetings were observed. Findings indicate that in some cases, structures for collaborative community engagement exist but functioning is ineffective for a number of reasons. Health facility committee meetings were most frequent when there were project funds, with discussions focusing mainly on construction projects as opposed to the day-to-day functioning of the facility. Committee members with the strongest influence and power had political connections or were retired government workers. There were no formal mechanisms for stakeholder forums and how these worked were unclear. Drug stock outs, funding delays and unclear operational guidelines affected collaborative governance performance. Conclusion Implementing collaborative governance effectively requires that the scope of focus for collaboration include both specific projects and the routine functioning of the primary health care facility by the health facility committee. In the study area, structures are required to manage effective stakeholder engagement. © 2021 Sitienei et al.

Design Before-and-after study design. Setting Primary health facilities in Gombe State, Northeastern Nigeria. Participants Monitoring and evaluation officers and maternal, newborn and child health coordinators for state-level and all 11 local government areas (district-equivalent) overseeing 492 primary care facilities offering maternal and newborn care services. Intervention Between April 2017 and December 2018, we implemented an integrated data quality intervention which included: introduction of job aids and regular self-assessment of data quality, peer-review and feedback, learning workshops, work planning for improvement, and ongoing support through social media. Outcome measures 9 metrics for the data quality dimensions of completeness and timeliness, internal consistency of reported data, and external consistency. Results The data quality intervention was associated with improvements in seven of nine data quality metrics assessed including availability and timeliness of reporting, completeness of data elements, accuracy of facility reporting, consistency between related data elements, and frequency of outliers reported. Improvement differed by data element type, with content of care and commodity-related data improving more than contact-related data. Increases in the consistency between related data elements demonstrated improved internal consistency within and across facility documentation. Conclusions An integrated district-focused data quality intervention-including regular self-assessment of data quality, peer-review and feedback, learning workshops, work planning for improvement, and ongoing support through social media-can increase the completeness, accuracy and internal consistency of facility-based routine data. ©},

This study aimed to analyze the correlation between meteorological conditions (temperature, relative humidity, sunshine duration, wind speed) and dynamics of the {COVID}-19 pandemic in Poland. Data on a daily number of laboratory-confirmed {COVID}-19 cases and the number of {COVID}-19-related deaths were gatheredfrom the official governmental website. Meteorological observations from 55 synoptic stations in Poland were used. Moreover, reports on the movement of people across different categories of places were collected. A cross-correlation function, principal component analysis and random forest were applied. Maximum temperature, sunshine duration, relative humidity and variability of mean daily temperature affected the dynamics of the {COVID}-19 pandemic. An increase intemperature and sunshine hours decreased the number of confirmed {COVID}-19 cases. The occurrence of high humidity caused an increase in the number of {COVID}-19 cases 14 days later. Decreased sunshine duration and increased air humidity had a negative impact on the number of {COVID}-19-related deaths.

	abstract = {Background: Emergency care is among the weakest parts of health systems in low-income countries with both quality and accessibility constraints. Previous studies estimated accessibility to surgical or emergency care based on population travel times to nearest hospital with no assessment of hospital readiness to provide such care. We analysed a Malawi national facility census with comprehensive inventory audits and geocoded facility locations to identify hospitals equipped to provide basic paediatric emergency care with estimated travel times to these hospitals from non-equipped facilities and in relation to Malawi's population distribution. Methods: We analysed a Malawi national facility census in 2013-2014 to identify hospitals equipped to manage critically ill children according to an extended version of {WHO} Emergency Triage, Assessment and Treatment ({ETAT}) guidelines. These guidelines include 25 components including staff, transport, equipment, diagnostics, medications, fluids, feeds and consumables that defined an emergency-equipped hospital in our study. We estimated travel times to emergency-equipped hospitals from non-equipped facilities and relative to population distributions using geocoded facility locations and an established accessibility mapping approach using global road network datasets from {OpenStreetMap} and Google. Results: Four (3.5, 95\% {CI}: 1.3-8.9) of 116 Malawi hospitals were emergency-equipped. Least available items were nasogastric tubes in 34.5\% of hospitals (95\% {CI}: 26.4-43.6), blood typing services (40.4, 95\% {CI}: 31.9-49.6), micro nebulizers (50.9, 95\% {CI}: 41.9-60.0), and radiology (54.2, 95\% {CI}: 45.1-63.0). Nationally, the median travel time from non-equipped facilities to the nearest emergency-equipped hospital was 73 min (95\% {CI}: 67-77) ranging 1-507 min. Approximately one-quarter (27\%) of Malawians lived over 120 min from an emergency-equipped hospital with significantly better accessibility in Central than North and South regions (16\% vs. 38 and 35\%, p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: There are unacceptable deficiencies in accessibility of basic paediatric emergency care in Malawi. Reliable supply chains for essential drugs and commodities are needed, particularly nasogastric tubes, asthma drugs and blood, along with improved capacity for time-sensitive referral. Further child mortality reductions will require substantial investments to expand basic paediatric emergency care into all Malawi hospitals for better managing critically ill children at highest mortality risk.  © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective To determine the proportion of essential and non-essential antimicrobial medicines that are registered on the drug registers in Kenya, Uganda and United Republic of Tanzania. Methods We categorized all antimicrobials on the national drug registers and essential medicines lists of the three countries using the British National Formulary. We also categorized all antibiotics according to the World Health Organization access, watch and reserve ({AWaRe}) classification. We calculated the proportions of essential and non-essential antimicrobials that were registered by antimicrobial class and {AWaRe} classification. Findings In 2018, Kenya had 2105 registered antimicrobials, Uganda had 1563 and the United Republic of Tanzania had 1327. Of these medicines, 1353 (64.3\%) were non-essential in Kenya, 798 (51.1\%) in Uganda and 706 (53.2\%) in the United Republic of Tanzania. Kenya had 160 antimicrobials on its national essential medicines lists, Uganda had 187 and the United Republic of Tanzania had 182; of these, 33 (20.7\%), 50 (26.7\%) and 52 (28.6\%) were not registered, respectively. High proportions of antimycobacterial and antiparasitic medicines were not registered. Of essential access antibiotics, 14.3\% (4/28) were not registered in Kenya, 8.6\% (3/35) in Uganda and 20.5\% (8/39) in the United Republic of Tanzania, nor were 25.0\% (3/12) of watch antibiotics in Kenya, 14.3\% (2/14) in Uganda and 19.1\% (4/21) in the United Republic of Tanzania. Conclusion Suboptimal registration of essential antimicrobials and over-registration of non-essential antimicrobials may encourage inappropriate use, especially since non-essential antimicrobials do not appear on national treatment guidelines. Countries should prioritize registration of the antimicrobial medicines on their essential medicines lists. © 2020, World Health Organization. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Across sub-Saharan Africa, evidence-based clinical guidelines to screen and manage hypertension exist; however, country level application is low due to lack of service readiness, uneven health worker motivation, weak accountability of health worker performance, and poor integration of hypertension screening and management with chronic care services. The systems analysis and improvement approach ({SAIA}) is an evidence-based implementation strategy that combines systems engineering tools into a five-step, facility-level package to improve understanding of gaps (cascade analysis), guide identification and prioritization of low-cost workflow modifications (process mapping), and iteratively test and redesign these modifications (continuous quality improvement). As hypertension screening and management are integrated into chronic care services in sub-Saharan Africa, an opportunity exists to test whether {SAIA} interventions shown to be effective in improving efficiency and coverage of {HIV} services can be effective when applied to the non-communicable disease services that leverage the same platform. We hypothesize that {SAIA}-hypertension ({SAIA}-{HTN}) will be effective as an adaptable, scalable model for broad implementation. Methods: We will deploy a hybrid type {III} cluster randomized trial to evaluate the impact of {SAIA}-{HTN} on hypertension management in eight intervention and eight control facilities in central Mozambique. Effectiveness outcomes include hypertension cascade flow measures (screening, diagnosis, management, control), as well as hypertension and {HIV} clinical outcomes among people living with {HIV}. Cost-effectiveness will be estimated as the incremental costs per additional patient passing through the hypertension cascade steps and the cost per additional disability-adjusted life year averted, from the payer perspective (Ministry of Health). {SAIA}-{HTN} implementation fidelity will be measured, and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research will guide qualitative evaluation of the implementation process in high-and low-performing facilities to identify determinants of intervention success and failure, and define core and adaptable components of the {SAIA}-{HTN} intervention. The Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change scale will measure facility-level readiness for adopting {SAIA}-{HTN}. Discussion: {SAIA} packages user-friendly systems engineering tools to guide decision-making by front-line health workers to identify low-cost, contextually appropriate chronic care improvement strategies. By integrating {SAIA} into routine hypertension screening and management structures, this pragmatic trial is designed to test a model for national scale-up.

	abstract = {Background Effective coverage research is increasing rapidly in global health and development, as researchers use a range of measures and combine data sources to adjust coverage for the quality of services received. However, most estimates of effective coverage that combine data sources are reported only as point estimates, which may be due to the challenge of calculating the variance for a composite measure. In this paper, we evaluate three methods to quantify the uncertainty in the estimation of effective coverage. Methods We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the exact, delta, and parametric bootstrap methods for constructing confidence intervals around point estimates that are calculated from combined data on coverage and quality. We assessed performance by computing the number of nominally 95\% confidence intervals that contain the truth for a range of coverage and quality values and data source sample sizes. To illustrate these approaches, we applied the delta and exact methods to estimates of adjusted coverage of antenatal care ({ANC}) in Senegal. We used household survey data for coverage and health facility assessments for readiness to provide services. Results With small sample sizes, when the true effective coverage value was close to the boundaries 0 or 1, the exact and parametric bootstrap methods resulted in substantial over or undercoverage and, for the exact method, a high proportion of invalid confidence intervals, while the delta method yielded modest overcoverage. The proportion of confidence intervals containing the truth in all three methods approached the intended 95\% with larger sample sizes and as the true effective coverage value moved away from the 0 or 1 boundary. Confidence intervals for adjusted {ANC} in Senegal were largely overlapping across the delta and exact methods, although at the sub-national level, the exact method produced invalid confidence intervals for estimates near 0 or 1. We provide the code to implement these methods. Conclusions The uncertainty around an effective coverage estimate can be characterized; this should become standard practice if effective coverage estimates are to become part of national and global health monitoring. The delta method approach outperformed the other methods in this study; we recommend its use for appropriate inference from effective coverage estimates that combine data sources, particularly when either sample size is small. When used for estimates created from facility type or regional strata, these methods require assumptions of independence that must be considered in each example. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Podoconiosis is one of the leading causes of lymphoedema-related morbidity in low-income settings, but little is known about the scale of its health and economic impact. This information is required to inform control programme planning and policy. In this study, we estimated the health and economic burden of podoconiosis in Ethiopia. Methods: We developed a model to estimate the health burden attributed to podoconiosis in terms of the number of disability-adjusted life years ({DALYs}) and the economic burden. We estimated the economic burden by quantifying the treatment and morbidity-management costs incurred by the healthcare system in managing clinical cases, patients' out-of-pocket costs and their productivity costs. Results: In 2017, there were 1.5 million cases of podoconiosis in Ethiopia, which corresponds to 172 073 {DALYs} or 182 per 100 000 people. The total economic burden of podoconiosis in Ethiopia is estimated to be {US}\$213.2 million annually and 91.1\% of this resulted from productivity costs. The average economic burden per podoconiosis case was {US}\$136.9. Conclusions: The national cost of podoconiosis is formidable. If control measures are scaled up and the morbidity burden reduced, this will lead to Ethiopia saving millions of dollars. Our estimates provide important benchmark economic costs to programme planners, policymakers and donors for resource allocation and priority setting. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Methods We extracted data from all demographic and health surveys conducted since 2010 on the type of facilities used for obtaining contraceptives, routine antenatal care and care for minor childhood diarrhoea and cough or fever. Using mixed-effects logistic regression models we assessed associations between hospital use and individual and country-level covariates. We assessed competence of care based on the receipt of essential clinical actions during visits. We also analysed three indicators of user experience from countries with available service provision assessment survey data. Findings On average across 56 countries, public hospitals were used as the sole source of care by 16.9\% of 126 012 women who obtained contraceptives, 23.1\% of 418 236 women who received routine antenatal care, 19.9\% of 47 677 children with diarrhoea and 18.5\% of 82 082 children with fever or cough. Hospital use was more common in richer countries with higher expenditures on health per capita and among urban residents and wealthier, better-educated women. Antenatal care quality was higher in hospitals in 44 countries. In a subset of eight countries, people using hospitals tended to spend more, report more problems and be somewhat less satisfied with the care received. Conclusion As countries work towards achieving ambitious health goals, they will need to assess care quality and user preferences to deliver effective primary care services that people want to use. © 2020, World Health Organization.

	abstract = {Background: In low and middle-income countries, pregnancy and delivery complications may deprive women and their newborns of life or the realization of their full potential. Provision of quality obstetric emergency and childbirth care can reduce maternal and newborn deaths. Underutilization of maternal and childbirth services remains a public health concern in Tanzania. The aim of this study was to explore elements of the local social, cultural, economic, and health systems that influenced the use of health facilities for delivery in a rural setting in Northwest Tanzania. Methods: A qualitative approach was used to explore community perceptions of issues related to low utilization of health facilities for childbirth. Between September and December 2017, 11 focus group discussions were conducted with women (n = 33), men (n = 5) and community health workers ({CHWs}; n = 28); key informant interviews were conducted with traditional birth attendants ({TBAs}; n = 2). Coding, identification, indexing, charting, and mapping of these interviews was done using {NVIVO} 12 after manual familiarization of the data. Data saturation was used to determine when no further interviews or discussions were required. Results: Four themes emerge; self-perceived obstetric risk, socio-cultural issues, economic concerns and health facility related factors. Health facility delivery was perceived to be crucial for complicated labor. However, the idea that childbirth was a "normal" process and lack of social and cultural acceptability of facility services, made home delivery appealing to many women and their families. In addition, out of pocket payments for suboptimal quality of health care was reported to hinder facility delivery. Conclusion: Home delivery persists in rural settings due to economic and social issues, and the cultural meanings attached to childbirth. Accessibility to and affordability of respectful and culturally acceptable childbirth services remain challenging in this setting. Addressing barriers on both the demand and supply side could result in improved maternal and child outcomes during labor and delivery. © 2020 The Author(s).},

This paper surveys households in rural south-western Uganda, which are geographically serviced by a voluntary Community-based health insurance scheme, and applied propensity score matching to assess the effect of enrolment on using mosquito nets and deworming under-five children. We find that enrolment in the scheme increased the probability of using a mosquito net by 26\% and deworming by 18\%. We postulate that these findings are partly mediated by information diffusion and social networks, financial protection, which gives households the capacity to save and use service more, especially curative services that are delivered alongside preventive services.

	abstract = {Introduction: African countries facing conflict have higher levels of maternal mortality. Understanding the gaps in the utilization of high-quality maternal health care is essential to improving maternal survival in these states. Few studies have estimated the impact of conflict on the quality of health care. In this study, we estimated the impact of conflict on the quality of health care in Kenya, a country with multiple overlapping conflicts and significant disparities in maternal survival. Materials and Methods: We drew on data on the observed quality of 553 antenatal care ({ANC}) visits between January and April 2010. Process quality was measured as the percentage of elements of client–provider interactions performed in these visits. For structural quality, we measured the percentage of required components of equipment and infrastructure and the management and supervision in the facility on the day of the visit. We spatially linked the analytical sample to conflict events from January to April 2010. We modeled the quality of {ANC} as a function of exposure to conflict using spatial difference-in-difference models. Results: {ANC} visits that occurred in facilities within 10,000 m of any conflict event in a high-conflict month received 18–21 percentage points fewer components of process quality on average and had a mean management and supervision score that was 12.8–13.5 percentage points higher. There was no significant difference in the mean equipment and infrastructure score at the 5\% level. The positive impact of conflict exposure on the quality of management and supervision was driven by rural facilities. The quality of management and supervision and equipment and infrastructure did not modify the impact of conflict on process quality. Discussion: Our study demonstrates the importance of designing maternal health policy based on the context-specific evidence on the mechanisms through which conflict affects health care. In Kenya, deterioration of equipment and infrastructure does not appear to be the main mechanism through which conflict has affected {ANC} quality. Further research should focus on better understanding the determinants of the gaps in process quality in conflict-affected settings, including provider motivation, competence, and incentives.

Methods This secondary data analysis used an adapted {WHO} near-miss methodology to collect cross-sectional maternal near-miss and abortion complications data at 43 health facilities in Central and Eastern Uganda in 2016-2017. We computed abortion severe morbidity, near-miss and mortality ratios per 100 000 live births, and described the proportion of cases that worsened to an abortion near-miss or death, stratified by geographical region and trimester. We tested for association between independent variables and abortion near-miss, and obtained prevalence ratios for association between second trimester near-miss and independent demographic and management indicators. We assessed health facility readiness for postabortion care provision in Central and Eastern regions. Results Of 3315 recorded severe abortion morbidity cases, 1507 were near-misses. Severe abortion morbidity, near-miss and mortality ratios were 2063, 938 and 23 per 100 000 live births, respectively. Abortion-related mortality ratios were 11 and 57 per 100 000 in Central and Eastern regions, respectively. Abortion near-miss cases were significantly associated with referral (p{\textless}0.001). Second trimester had greater abortion mortality than first trimester. Eastern region had greater abortion-related morbidity and mortality than Central region with facilities in the former characterised by inferior readiness to provide postabortion care. Conclusions Uganda has a major abortion near-miss morbidity and mortality; with mortality higher in the second trimester. Life-saving commodities are lacking especially in Eastern region compromising facility readiness for postabortion care provision.  ©},

	abstract = {Background: Contraceptive services are essential for promoting people's health, and economic and social well-being. Despite increased contraceptive use over the past decades, unmet need is still high in Malawi. As a result of task shifting, health surveillance assistants ({HSAs}), Malawi's paid community health worker cadre, provide an expanded range of contraceptive services, aimed at increasing access at community level. We conducted a qualitative study to explore enabling and hindering factors of {HSAs}' roles in the provision of modern contraceptive services in Mangochi district, Malawi. Methods: The study involved {HSAs} and their supervisors, a variety of community members, health workers and policy makers using 34 interviews and 12 focus group discussions. Data were recorded, transcribed, translated, coded and thematically analysed according to a framework that included community-, {HSA}- and health system-related factors. Results: {HSAs} were found to be trusted providers of contraceptive services. At community level, gender norms, decision-making and beliefs about contraceptives were intertwined. They resulted in women using contraceptive services, including those offered by {HSAs}, in secret. There were misconceptions about contraceptives among both men and women, which were insufficiently addressed by {HSAs}. Residence and age of {HSAs} influenced their role in the provision of contraceptive services to (young) community members, whereas sex was not regarded as an enabling or hindering factor. While most community members reported to be satisfied with the quality of {HSAs}' services, quality was compromised by a lack of contraceptive supplies and other resources, and limited supportive supervision and training. Conclusions: {HSAs} in Mangochi are important contraceptive service providers. Their ability to ensure male involvement, increase access to services for youth and address misconceptions about contraceptives needs improvement. This requires a thorough understanding of socio-cultural norms and improved behavioural change communication competencies, which need to be incorporated in future training under Malawi's Community Health Strategy. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Madagascar's Malaria National Strategic Plan 2018-2022 calls for progressive malaria elimination beginning in low-incidence districts ({\textless} 1 case/1000 population). Optimizing access to prompt diagnosis and quality treatment and improving outbreak detection and response will be critical to success. A malaria elimination readiness assessment ({MERA}) was performed in health facilities ({HFs}) of selected districts targeted for malaria elimination. Methods: A mixed methods survey was performed in September 2018 in five districts of Madagascar. Randomly selected {HFs} were assessed for availability of malaria commodities and frequency of training and supervision conducted. Health providers ({HPs}) and community health volunteers ({CHVs}) were interviewed, and outpatient consultations at {HFs} were observed. To evaluate elimination readiness, a composite score ranging from 0 to 100 was designed from all study tools and addressed four domains: (1) resource availability, (2) case management ({CM}), (3) data management and use, and (4) training, supervision, and technical assistance; scores were calculated for each {HF} catchment area and district based on survey responses. Stakeholder interviews on malaria elimination planning were conducted at national, regional and district levels. Results: A quarter of the 35 {HFs} surveyed had no rapid diagnostic tests ({RDTs}). Of 129 patients with reported or recorded fever among 300 consultations observed, {HPs} tested 56 (43\%) for malaria. Three-quarters of the 35 {HF} managers reviewed data for trends. Only 68\% of 41 {HPs} reported receiving malaria-specific training. Of 34 {CHVs} surveyed, 24\% reported that treating fever was no longer among their responsibilities. Among treating {CHVs}, 13 (50\%) reported having {RDTs}, and 11 (42\%) had anti-malarials available. The average district elimination readiness score was 52 out of 100, ranging from 48 to 57 across districts. Stakeholders identified several challenges to commodity management, malaria {CM}, and epidemic response related to lack of training and funding disruptions. Conclusion: This evaluation highlighted gaps in malaria {CM} and elimination readiness in Madagascar to address during elimination planning. Strategies are needed that include training, commodity provision, supervision, and support for {CHVs}. The {MERA} can be repeated to assess progress in filling identified gaps and is a feasible tool that could be used to assess elimination targets in other countries. © 2020 The Author(s).},

The prevalence of {HIV} is high among South African women of reproductive age, and the transmission of {HIV} from mothers to children is a serious concern. The study explored contributory factors, which lead to an increase in mother-to-child transmission of {HIV} at selected clinics in Capricorn district of Limpopo Province. Material and methods: The study adopted a qualitative descriptive exploratory design to uncover factors leading to {MTCT} of {HIV}. The target population were professional nurses trained in primary healthcare. Purposive sampling technique was used to sample eighteen participants from Seshego Zone clinics in Capricorn district. Unstructured interviews were conducted and audio-recorded. The transcribed data was analyzed using Tesch’s’ method of data analysis, and presented in themes and sub-themes. Ethical considerations were ensured throughout the study as well as trustworthiness of findings. Results: The study revealed that poor socio-economic status, traditional and religious beliefs, and lack of knowledge of patients were the major factors contributing to an increase of {MTCT} of {HIV} as well as system-related factors. However, the study indicated high knowledge about {MTCT} and {HIV} among the nurses. Conclusions: The study revealed that patient-related factors cause high prevalence of {MTCT} of {HIV}. For community health awareness, it is highly recommended to encourage women to abandon their beliefs in order to promote {PMTCT}. © 2021 Termedia Publishing House Ltd.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: {UNAIDS} has prioritised Malawi and 21 other countries in sub-Saharan Africa for fast-tracking the end of their {HIV} epidemics. {UNAIDS}' elimination strategy requires achieving a treatment coverage of 90\% by 2030. However, many individuals in the prioritised countries have to travel long distances to access {HIV} treatment and few have access to motorised transportation. Using data-based geospatial modelling, we investigated whether these two factors are barriers to achieving {HIV} elimination in Malawi and assessed the effect of increasing bicycle availability on expanding treatment coverage. Methods: We built a data-based geospatial model that we used to estimate the minimum travel time needed to access treatment, for every person living with {HIV} in Malawi. We constructed our model by combining a spatial map of health-care facilities, a map that showed the number of {HIV}-infected individuals per km2, and an impedance map. We quantified impedance using data on road and river networks, land cover, and topography. We estimated travel times for the existing coverage of 70\%, and the time that {HIV}-infected individuals would need to spend travelling in order to achieve a coverage of 90\%, whether driving, bicycling, or walking. Findings: We identified a quantitative relationship between the maximum achievable coverage of treatment and the minimum travel time to the nearest health-care facility. At 70\% coverage, health-care facilities can be reached within approximately 45 min if driving, 65 min if bicycling, and 85 min if walking. Increasing coverage above 70\% will become progressively more difficult. To reach 90\% coverage, many {HIV}-infected individuals (who have yet to initiate treatment) will need to travel for almost twice as long as those already on treatment. Bicycling, rather than walking, in rural areas would substantially increase the maximum achievable coverage. Interpretation: The long travel times needed to reach health-care facilities coupled with little motorised transportation in rural areas are substantial barriers to reaching 90\% coverage in Malawi. Increased bicycle availability could help eliminate {HIV}. Funding: {US} National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Background: Universal salt iodization ({USI}) is the most feasible and cost-effective, and equitable, approach to prevent iodine deficiency. Severe maternal iodine deficiency during pregnancy is associated with serious adverse gestational and birth outcomes. Objectives: The aim was to assess iodine status and identify independent factors associated with urinary iodine concentration ({UIC}) among women of reproductive age in Tanzania. Methods: This was a weighted, population-based, cross-sectional study in 2985 women of reproductive age (20-49 y) in Tanzania who participated in the Demographic and Health Surveys in 2015-2016 ({DHS} 2015-2016) and had measured {UIC}. Multivariable generalized linear regression was used to identify potential factors that were associated with {UIC}. Results: The median {UICs} among women consuming inadequately iodized salt (93.6 μg/L; 25th and 75th percentiles: 43.1, 197.9 μg/L) and women in the lowest socioeconomic status (92.3 μg/L; 45.6, 194.4 μg/L) were below the {WHO}-recommended ranges (≥150 μg/L for pregnant women and ≥100 μg/L for nonpregnant women). The results of multivariable models indicated that pregnant women had 1.21 μg/L lower {UIC} than nonpregnant women (β =-1.21; 95\% {CI}:-3.42,-0.12), breastfeeding women had 1.02 μg/L lower {UIC} than nonbreastfeeding women (β =-1.02; 95\% {CI}:-2.25,-0.27), and women with no education had a 1.88 μg/L lower {UIC} compared with those with secondary/highest education (β =-1.88; 95\% {CI}:-4.58,-0.36). Women consuming inadequately iodized salt had 6.55 μg/L lower {UIC} than those consuming adequately iodized salt (β =-6.55; 95\% {CI}:-9.24,-4.33). The median {UIC} varied substantially across geographic zones, ranging from 83.2 μg/L (45.9, 165.3) in the Western region to 347.8 μg/L (185.0, 479.8) in the Eastern region. Conclusions: Our findings indicated a great heterogeneity in median {UIC} across regions of Tanzania among women of reproductive age. Poverty, consuming inadequately iodized salt, and lack of education appeared to be the driving factors for lower {UIC} in Tanzania.

Methods: In this observational study, we enrolled equal numbers of {HIV} concordant and discordant couples in four rural and four urban clinics, with two Catholic and two non-Catholic clinics in each area. Eligible couples were fertile, not already using a {LARC} method, and wished to limit or delay fertility for at least 2 years. We provided {CVCT} and fertility goal-based family planning counselling with the offer of {LARC} and conducted multivariate analysis of clinic, couple, and individual predictors of {LARC} uptake. Results: Of 1290 couples enrolled, 960 (74\%) selected {LARC}: Jadelle 5-year implant (37\%), Implanon 3-year implant (26\%), or copper intrauterine device ({IUD}) (11\%). Uptake was higher in non-Catholic clinics (85\% vs. 63\% in Catholic clinics, p {\textless} 0.0001), in urban clinics (82\% vs. 67\% in rural clinics, p {\textless} 0.0001), and in {HIV} concordant couples (79\% vs. 70\% of discordant couples, p =.0005). Religion of the couple was unrelated to clinic religious affiliation, and uptake was highest among Catholics (80\%) and lowest among Protestants (70\%) who were predominantly Pentecostal. In multivariable analysis, urban location and non-Catholic clinic affiliation, Catholic religion of woman or couple, younger age of men, lower educational level of both partners, non-use of condoms or injectable contraception at enrollment, prior discussion of {LARC} by the couple, and women not having concerns about negative side effects of implant were associated with {LARC} uptake. Conclusions: Fertility goal-based {LARC} recommendations combined with couples' {HIV} counselling and testing resulted in a high uptake of {LARC} methods, even among discordant couples using condoms for {HIV} prevention, in Catholic clinics, and in rural populations.

	abstract = {Background Cardiovascular diseases are leading causes of death, globally, and health systems that deliver quality clinical care are needed to manage an increasing number of people with risk factors for these diseases. Indicators of preparedness of countries to manage cardiovascular disease risk factors ({CVDRFs}) are regularly collected by ministries of health and global health agencies. We aimed to assess whether these indicators are associated with patient receipt of quality clinical care. Methods and findings We did a secondary analysis of cross-sectional, nationally representative, individual-patient data from 187,552 people with hypertension (mean age 48.1 years, 53.5\% female) living in 43 low- and middle-income countries ({LMICs}) and 40,795 people with diabetes (mean age 52.2 years, 57.7\% female) living in 28 {LMICs} on progress through cascades of care (condition diagnosed, treated, or controlled) for diabetes or hypertension, to indicate outcomes of provision of quality clinical care. Data were extracted from national-level World Health Organization ({WHO}) Stepwise Approach to Surveillance ({STEPS}), or other similar household surveys, conducted between July 2005 and November 2016. We used mixed-effects logistic regression to estimate associations between each quality clinical care outcome and indicators of country development (gross domestic product [{GDP}] per capita or Human Development Index [{HDI}]); national capacity for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases (‘{NCD} readiness indicators’ from surveys done by {WHO}); health system finance (domestic government expenditure on health [as percentage of {GDP}], private, and out-of-pocket expenditure on health [both as percentage of current]); and health service readiness (number of physicians, nurses, or hospital beds per 1,000 people) and performance (neonatal mortality rate). All models were adjusted for individual-level predictors including age, sex, and education. In an exploratory analysis, we tested whether national-level data on facility preparedness for diabetes were positively associated with outcomes. Associations were inconsistent between indicators and quality clinical care outcomes. For hypertension, {GDP} and {HDI} were both positively associated with each outcome. Of the 33 relationships tested between {NCD} readiness indicators and outcomes, only two showed a significant positive association: presence of guidelines with being diagnosed (odds ratio [{OR}], 1.86 [95\% {CI} 1.08–3.21], p = 0.03) and availability of funding with being controlled ({OR}, 2.26 [95\% {CI} 1.09–4.69], p = 0.03). Hospital beds ({OR}, 1.14 [95\% {CI} 1.02–1.27], p = 0.02), nurses/midwives ({OR}, 1.24 [95\% {CI} 1.06–1.44], p = 0.006), and physicians ({OR}, 1.21 [95\% {CI} 1.11–1.32], p {\textless} 0.001) per 1,000 people were positively associated with being diagnosed and, similarly, with being treated; and the number of physicians was additionally associated with being controlled ({OR}, 1.12 [95\% {CI} 1.01–1.23], p = 0.03). For diabetes, no positive associations were seen between {NCD} readiness indicators and outcomes. There was no association between country development, health service finance, or health service performance and readiness indicators and any outcome, apart from {GDP} ({OR}, 1.70 [95\% {CI} 1.12–2.59], p = 0.01), {HDI} ({OR}, 1.21 [95\% {CI} 1.01–1.44], p = 0.04), and number of physicians per 1,000 people ({OR}, 1.28 [95\% {CI} 1.09–1.51], p = 0.003), which were associated with being diagnosed. Six countries had data on cascades of care and nationwide-level data on facility preparedness. Of the 27 associations tested between facility preparedness indicators and outcomes, the only association that was significant was having metformin available, which was positively associated with treatment ({OR}, 1.35 [95\% {CI} 1.01–1.81], p = 0.04). The main limitation was use of blood pressure measurement on a single occasion to diagnose hypertension and a single blood glucose measurement to diagnose diabetes. Conclusion In this study, we observed that indicators of country preparedness to deal with {CVDRFs} are poor proxies for quality clinical care received by patients for hypertension and diabetes. The major implication is that assessments of countries’ preparedness to manage {CVDRFs} should not rely on proxies; rather, it should involve direct assessment of quality clinical care. © 2020 Davies et al.

	abstract = {Sierra Leone is one of the least developed low-income countries ({LICs}), slowly recovering from the effects of a devastating civil war and an Ebola outbreak. The health care system is characterized by chronic shortage of skilled human resources, equipment, and essential medicines. The referral system is weak and vulnerable, with 75\% of the country having insufficient access to essential health care. Consequently, Sierra Leone has the highest maternal and child mortality rates in the world. This manuscript describes the implementation of a National Emergency Medical Service ({NEMS}), a project aiming to create the first prehospital emergency medical system in the country. In 2017, a joint venture of Doctors with Africa ({CUAMM}), Veneto Region, and Research Center in Emergency and Disaster Medicine ({CRIMEDIM}) was developed to support the Ministry of Health and Sanitation ({MOHS}) in designing and managing the {NEMS} system, one of the very few structured, fully equipped, and free-of-charge prehospital service in the African continent. The {NEMS} design was the result of an in-depth research phase that included a preliminary assessment, literature review, and consultations with key stakeholders and managers of similar systems in other African countries. From May 27, 2019, after a timeframe of six months in which all the districts have been progressively trained and made operational, the {NEMS} became operative at national level. By the end of March 2020, the {NEMS} operation center ({OC}) and the 81 ambulances dispatched on the ground handled a total number of 36,814 emergency calls, 35,493 missions, and 31,036 referrals.  © The Author(s), 2020.

Aims: A narrative review was conducted with the aim of mapping current nutrition policies and capacity development initiatives to assess policy and the institutional environment and identify gaps and opportunities. Methods: A comprehensive, broad based search was conducted, including databases and websites and policy and programme documents. Results: The policy focuses on multisectoral efforts to address nutrition challenges; however; implementation of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions is not delivered uniformly at the community level due to continued conflic situations and geographic inaccessibility, lack of availability of trained human resources and weak institutions. There is limited evidence on the effectiveness of nutrition programmes in Afghanistan. Limited policy provisions are available to address nutrition issues due to the rising burden of noncommunicable diseases, urbanization and changing dietary patterns. The shortage of skilled nutritional professionals is a critical issue. Lack of institutional capacity, educational standards and accreditation mechanism poses major challenges. Ongoing training programmes are fragmented and fail to meet the requirements of a professional nutrition workforce. Conclusion: The findings highlight that well-structured policies and strategies focusing on maternal and child nutrition provide an enabling policy environment to scale up nutrition interventions. Evidence on the implementation of programmes is needed to aid policy recommendations. The lack of an institutional mechanism for professional nutrition education highlights the great need for action in Afghanistan for public health nutrition and education. © World Health Organization ({WHO}) 2021.},

	abstract = {Background Achieving maternal and newborn related Sustainable Development Goals targets is challenging for Nepal, mainly due to poor quality of maternity services. In this context, we aim to assess the Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care ({BEmONC}) service availability and readiness in health facilities in Nepal by analyzing data from Nepal Health Facility Survey ({NHFS}), 2015. Methods We utilized cross-sectional data from the nationally representative {NHFS}, 2015. Service availability was measured by seven signal functions of {BEmONC}, and service readiness by the availability and functioning of supportive items categorized into three domains: Staff and guidelines, diagnostic equipment, and basic medicine and commodities. We used the World Health Organization's service availability and readiness indicators to estimate the readiness scores. We performed a multiple linear regression to identify important factors in the readiness of the health facilities to provide {BEmONC} services. Results The {BEmONC} service readiness score was significantly higher in public hospitals compared with private hospitals and peripheral public health facilities. Significant factors associated with service readiness score were the facility type (14.69 points higher in public hospitals, P{\textless}0.001), number of service delivery staff (2.49 points increase per each additional delivery staff, P{\textless}0.001), the service hours (4.89 points higher in facilities offering 24-hour services, P = 0.01) and status of periodic review of maternal and newborn deaths (4.88 points higher in facilities that conducted periodic review, P = 0.043). Conclusions These findings suggest that {BEmONC} services in Nepal could be improved by increasing the number of service delivery staff, expanding service hours to 24-hours a day, and conducting periodic review of maternal and newborn deaths at health facilities, mainly in the peripheral public health facilities. The private hospitals need to be encouraged for {BEmONC} service readiness. © 2021 Acharya et al.

	abstract = {Background: Pathology and laboratory medicine diagnostics and diagnostic imaging are crucial to achieving universal health coverage. We analysed Service Provision Assessments ({SPAs}) from ten low-income and middle-income countries to benchmark diagnostic availability. Methods: Diagnostic availabilities were determined for Bangladesh, Haiti, Malawi, Namibia, Nepal, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda, with multiple timepoints for Haiti, Kenya, Senegal, and Tanzania. A smaller set of diagnostics were included in the analysis for primary care facilities compared with those expected at hospitals, with 16 evaluated in total. Surveys spanned 2004–18, including 8512 surveyed facilities. Country-specific facility types were mapped to basic primary care, advanced primary care, or hospital tiers. We calculated percentages of facilities offering each diagnostic, accounting for facility weights, stratifying by tier, and for some analyses, region. The tier-level estimate of diagnostic availability was defined as the median of all diagnostic-specific availabilities at each tier, and country-level estimates were the median of all diagnostic-specific availabilities of each of the tiers. Associations of country-level diagnostic availability with country income as well as (within-country) region-level availability with region-specific population densities were determined by multivariable linear regression, controlling for appropriate covariates including tier. Findings: Median availability of diagnostics was 19·1\% in basic primary care facilities, 49·2\% in advanced primary care facilities, and 68·4\% in hospitals. Availability varied considerably between diagnostics, ranging from 1·2\% (ultrasound) to 76·7\% (malaria) in primary care (basic and advanced) and from 6·1\% ({CT} scan) to 91·6\% (malaria) in hospitals. Availability also varied between countries, from 14·9\% (Bangladesh) to 89·6\% (Namibia). Availability correlated positively with log(income) at both primary care tiers but not the hospital tier, and positively with region-specific population density at the basic primary care tier only. Interpretation: Major gaps in diagnostic availability exist in many low-income and middle-income countries, particularly in primary care facilities. These results can serve as a benchmark to gauge progress towards implementing guidelines such as the {WHO} Essential Diagnostics List and Priority Medical Devices initiatives.

	abstract = {Background: Experience of care is a pillar of quality care; positive experiences are essential during health care encounters and integral to quality health service delivery. Yet, we lack synthesised knowledge of how private sector delivery of quality care affects experiences of care amongst mothers, newborns, and children. To fill this gap, we conducted a systematic review that examined quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies on the provision of maternal, newborn, and child health ({MNCH}) care by private providers in low- and middle-income countries ({LMICs}). This manuscript focuses on experience of care, including respectful care, and satisfaction with care. Methods: Our protocol followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Searches were conducted in eight electronic databases (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, {EconLit}, Excerpta Medica Database, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Popline, {PubMed}, {ScienceDirect}, and Web of Science) and two websites and supplemented with hand-searches and expert recommendations. For inclusion, studies examining private sector delivery of quality care amongst mothers, newborns, and children in {LMICs} must have examined maternal, newborn, and/or child morbidity or mortality; quality of care; experience of care; and/or service utilisation. Data were extracted for descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results: Of the 139 studies included, 45 studies reported data on experience of care. Most studies reporting experience of care were conducted in India, Bangladesh, and Uganda. Experiences of private care amongst mothers, newborns, and children aligned with four components of quality of care: patient-centeredness, timeliness, effectiveness, and equity. Interpersonal relationships with health care workers were essential to experience of care, in particular staff friendliness, positive attitudes, and time spent with health care providers. Experience of care can be a stronger determining factor in {MNCH}-related decision-making than the quality of services provided. Conclusion: Positive experiences of care in private facilities can be linked more broadly to privileges of private care that allow for shorter waiting times and more provider time spent with mothers, newborns, and children. Little is known about experiences of private sector care amongst children. Trial registration: This systematic review was registered with the {PROSPERO} international prospective register of systematic reviews (registration number {CRD}42019143383). © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria among pregnant women with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ({IPTp}-{SP}), is one of the three recommended interventions for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy ({MiP}) in sub-Sahara Africa. The World Health Organisation recommended in 2012 that {SP} be given at each scheduled {ANC} visit except during the first trimester and can be given a dose every month until the time of delivery, to ensure that a high proportion of women receive at least three doses of {SP} during pregnancy. Despite implementation of this policy, Ghana did not attain the target of 100\% access to {IPTp}-{SP} by 2015. Additionally, negative outcomes of malaria infection in pregnancy are still recurring. This ethnographic study explored how health system, individual and socio-cultural factors influence {IPTp}-{SP} uptake in two Ghanaian regions. Methods The study design was ethnographic, employing non-participant observation, case studies and in depth interviews in 8 health facilities and 8 communities, from April 2018 to March 2019, in two Ghanaian regions. Recommended ethical procedures were observed. Results Health system factors such as organization of antenatal care ({ANC}) services and strategies employed by health workers to administer {SP} contributed to initial uptake. Women’s trust in the health care system contributed to continued uptake. Inadequate information provided to women accessing {ANC}, stock-outs and fees charged for {ANC} services reduced access to {IPTp}-{SP}. Socio-cultural factor such as encouragement from social networks influenced utilization of {ANC} services and {IPTp}-{SP} uptake. Individual factors such as refusing to take {SP}, skipping {ANC} appointments and initiating {ANC} attendance late affected uptake. Conclusion Health system, socio-cultural and individual factors influence uptake of optimum doses of {IPTp}-{SP}. Consequently, interventions that aim at addressing {IPTp}-{SP} uptake should focus on regular and sufficient supply of {SP} to health facilities, effective implementation of free {ANC}, provision of appropriate and adequate information to women and community outreach programmes to encourage early and regular {ANC} visits.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among girls in advanced-level secondary schools in the Rukwa region of Tanzania. Using probability proportional to size ({PPS}), we recruited a random sample of 660 girls out of 1447-targeted participants. A tool for data collection was a questionnaire. Data analyses included univariate analysis to describe study participants and Poisson regression analysis to assess the effect of independent factors to the dependent variable. A 5\%-level of significance was used in multivariate analysis. Results: More than 40\% of the girls report being sexually active and only 25\% reported current use of modern contraceptives. The main reported main method being use of male condoms (93\%). Barriers for non-use of contraceptives included fear of side effects, fear of being perceived or labeled as promiscuous, inadequate knowledge about contraceptives and for religious reasons. The predictor for using modern contraceptives was attending class sessions about modern contraceptives. Conclusions: Although girls in advanced-level secondary schools are sexually active, the use of modern contraceptives is still low. Girls report several barriers frustrating their intention to use contraceptives, mainly based on misconceptions and lack of knowledge.  © 2020 Walter de Gruyter {GmbH}, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {Background Ethiopia is a Sub-Saharan country with very high neonatal mortality rates, varying across its regions. The rate of neonatal mortality reduction in Ethiopia is slow, and Ethiopia may not meet the third United Nations sustainable development target by 2030. This study aimed to investigate the spatial variations and contributing factors for neonatal mortality rates in Ethiopia. Methods We analysed data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey ({EDHS}), which used a two-stage cluster sampling technique with a census enumeration area as primary and households as secondary sampling units. A Bayesian spatial logistic regression model using the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation ({SPDE}) method was fitted accounting for socio-economic, health service-related and geographic factors. Results Higher neonatal mortality rates were observed in eastern, northeastern and southeastern Ethiopia, and the Somali region had higher risks of neonatal mortality. Neonates from frequently drought-affected areas had a higher mortality risk than less drought-affected areas. Application of traditional substances on the cord increased the risk of neonatal mortality (Adjusted Odds Ratio ({AOR}) = 2.07, 95\% Credible Interval ({CrI}): 1.12 to 4.30) and getting health facility delivery services had a lower odds of neonatal mortality ({AOR} = 0.60, 95\% {CrI}: 0.37, 0.98). Conclusions Residing in drought-affected areas, applying traditional substances on the umbilical cord and not delivering at health facilities were associated with a higher risk of neonatal mortality. Policy-makers and resource administrators at different administrative levels could leverage the findings to prioritise and target areas identified with higher neonatal mortality rates.  © 2022 Kibret et al.

	abstract = {Introduction: Ensuring adequate access to contraceptive implant removal services requires an understanding of potential clinical, logistical, and geographic challenges. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 39 public health facilities in two districts of Senegal. To assess facility readiness, we reported the proportion of facilities meeting all minimum conditions for regular and difficult implant removals. We then describe characteristics of referral networks. Geographic access modeling was conducted in a geographic information system to estimate the proportion of women of reproductive age living within specific travel times of facilities ready for regular and difficult removals. Results: 72\% of facilities met all conditions for regular removals, and 8\% for difficult removals. In both cases, the main gaps related to equipment availability (79\% of facilities had the minimum equipment for regular removals and 8\% for difficult removals). 72\% of facilities organized in three referral networks sent clients to other facilities for cases they could not manage. Of 11 receiving or single-network facilities, seven were ready for regular removals and one for difficult removals. Altogether, 36\% of women in Dakar Centre and 99\% of women in Kolda lived within two hours of a facility that was equipped to handle regular removals, compared to 15\% and 69\%, respectively, for difficult removals. Conclusion: Data such as those provided in this assessment are important to provide a realistic picture of the state of readiness of the health system and its ability to meet the inevitable demand for implant removals. Referral networks should be considered as an emerging strategy to avail sufficient capacity at the systems level, including for managing difficult removals. However, careful thought should be given to the location of facilities that are ready to receive cases in order to target upgrades. 2022 Brunie, Parker, Ndiaye, Sarr Aw, Keyes, Lebetkin, Dioh, {MacCarthy} and Ndiaye.},

	abstract = {Objective: To assess the care for hypertension in Sierra Leone, by the use of a cascade-of-care approach, to identify where the need for healthcare system interventions is greatest. Methods: Using data from a nationwide household survey on surgical conditions undertaken in 1956 participants ≥18 years from October 2019 to March 2020, a cascade of care for hypertension consisting of four categories – hypertensive population, those diagnosed, those treated and those controlled – was constructed. Hypertension was defined as having a blood pressure ≥140/90 {mmHg}, or self-reported use of antihypertensive medication. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate factors associated with undiagnosed hypertension. Results: The prevalence of hypertension was 22\%. Among those with hypertension, 23\% were diagnosed, 11\% were treated and 5\% had controlled blood pressure. The largest loss to care (77\%) was between being hypertensive and receiving a diagnosis. Male sex, age and living in a rural location, were significantly associated with the odds of undiagnosed hypertension. There was no significant difference between men and women in the number of patients with controlled blood pressure. Adults aged 40 or older were observed to be better retained in care compared with those younger than 40 years of age. Conclusion: There is a significant loss to care in the care cascade for hypertension in Sierra Leone. Our results suggest that increasing awareness of cardiovascular risk and risk factor screening for early diagnosis might have a large impact on hypertension care. © 2021 The Authors Tropical Medicine \& International Health Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Studies in Ethiopia show an increasing trend in maternal health service use, such as having at least 4 visits of antenatal care ({ANC}4+) and skilled birth attendance ({SBA}). Improving the health information system ({HIS}) is an intervention that can improve service uptake and quality. We conducted a baseline study to measure current maternal service coverage, {HIS} performance status, and their relationship. Methods: We conducted a linked health facility-level and population-based survey from September 2020 to October 2020. The study covers all regions of Ethiopia. For the population-based survey, 3,016 mothers were included. Overall, 81 health posts, 71 health centers, and 15 hospitals were selected for the facility survey. A two-stage sampling procedure was applied to select target households. The study used modified Performance of Routine Information System Management tools for the facility survey and a structured questionnaire for the household survey. Multilevel logistic regression was employed to account for clustering and control for likely confounders. Results: Maternal service indicators, {ANC}4+ visits (54.0\%), {SBA} (75.8\%), postnatal care (70.6\%), and cesarean delivery (9\%) showed good service uptake. All data quality and use indicators showed lower performance compared to the national target of 90\%. Maternal education and higher levels of wealth index were significantly and positively associated with all selected maternal service indicators. Longer distance from health facilities was significantly and negatively associated with {SBA} and the maternal care composite indicator. Among {HIS}-related indicators, availability of electronic {HIS} tools was significantly associated with maternal care composite indicator and {ANC}4+. Conclusions: Maternal service indicators showed promising performance. However, current {HIS} performance is suboptimal. Both service user and {HIS}-related factors were associated with maternal service uptake. Conducting similar research outside of the project sites will be helpful to have a wider understanding and better coverage. © Worku et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Large parts of Malawi`s population lack access to health care. A high burden of disease, chronic poverty, and a growing population accelerate the need for extending and improving health care. One region that is struggling with service provision is Malawi´s rural district Phalombe. In addition to adequate resources, acceptability of service provision and productive patient-provider engagements are crucial determinants of health-seeking behaviour. Objective: This study aimed to better understand the interdependencies between acceptability, patient-provider engagement, and health-seeking behaviour in Phalombe. By targeting health care providers and community members, different perspectives were assessed and triangulated. Methods: Following a qualitative approach, group interviews were conducted with community members of three rural villages (n = 21) in Phalombe. Semi-structured interviews (n = 2) and a group interview among management staff (n = 3) provided insight into experiences of health care providers. Results: Community members perceived health care providers’ behaviour as disrespectful, resulting in power gaps between patients and providers. Providers blamed community members’ cultural beliefs and lack of awareness regarding health care as barriers to seek formal services. Systemic shortcomings diminished community members’ trust in service provision, while increasing frustration among providers and thus impacting patient-provider engagement. Due to insufficient resources, lack of acceptability and trust in receiving adequate services, potential patients turned into non-users of health care. Conclusions: A patient-centred approach is needed that empowers communities by involving them in health care planning, in facility management, and by raising awareness towards health issues. Trainings for providers need to focus on improving communication and building trustful patient-provider interactions. Yet, without addressing systemic constraints, providers’ frustration and patients’ lack of trust in service provision will remain and impact their health-seeking behaviour. Thus, further budget needs to be allocated to Malawi’s health care sector in order to provide resources needed. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background Globally, three fourth of neonatal deaths occur during the early neonatal period, this makes it a critical time to reduce the burden of neonatal death. The survival status of a newborn is determined by the individual (neonatal and maternal), and facility-level factors. Several studies were conducted in Ethiopia to assess early neonatal death; however, most of the studies had limited participants and did not well address the two main determinant factors covered in this study. In response to this gap, this study attempted to examine factors related to early neonatal death based on perinatal death surveillance data in consideration of all the possible determinants of early neonatal death. Methods The national perinatal death surveillance data were used for this study. A total of 3814 reviewed perinatal deaths were included in the study. Bayesian multilevel parametric survival analysis was employed to identify factors affecting the survival of newborns during the early neonatal period. Adjusted time ratio ({ATR}) with 95\% Bayesian credible intervals ({CrI}) was reported and log-likelihood was used for model comparison. Statistical significance was declared based on the non-inclusion of 1.0 in the 95\% {CrI}. Result More than half (52.4\%) of early neonatal deaths occurred within the first two days of birth. Per the final model, as gestational age increases by a week the risk of dying during the early neonatal period is reduced by 6\% [{ATR} = 0.94,95\%{CrI}:(0.93-0.96)]. There was an increased risk of death during the early neonatal period among neonates deceased due to birth injury as compared to neonates who died due to infection [{ATR} = 2.05,95\%{CrI}:(1.30- 3.32)]; however, perinates who died due to complication of an intrapartum event had a lower risk of death than perinates who died due to infection [{ATR} = 0.87,95\%{CrI}:(0.83-0.90)]. As the score of delay one and delay three increases by one unit, the newborn's likelihood of surviving during the early neonatal period is reduced by 4\% [{ATR} = 1.04,95\%{CrI}:(1.01-1.07)] and 21\% [{ATR} = 1.21,95\%{CrI}:(1.15-1.27)] respectively. Neonates born from mothers living in a rural area had a higher risk of dying during the early neonatal period than their counterparts living in an urban area [{ATR} = 3.53,95\%{CrI}:(3.34-3.69)]. As compared to neonates treated in a primary health facility, being treated in secondary [{ATR} = 1.14,95\%{CrI}:(1.02- 1.27)] and tertiary level of care [{ATR} = 1.15,95\%{CrI}:(1.04-1.25)] results in a higher risk of death during the early neonatal period. Conclusion The survival of a newborn during the early neonatal period is determined by both individual (gestational age, cause of death, and delay one) and facility (residence, type of health facility and delay three) level factors. Thus, to have a positive early neonatal outcome, a tailored intervention is needed for the three major causes of death (i.e Infection, birth injury, and complications of the intrapartum period). Furthermore, promoting maternal health, improving the health-seeking behaviour of mothers, strengthening facility readiness, and narrowing down inequalities in service provision are recommended to improve the newborn's outcomes during the early neonatal period.  © 2022 Tesfay et al.

This study aimed to map and compare the availability and diversity of current mental health service provision for children and adolescents in Australia. We used a standardised service classification instrument, the Description and Evaluation of Services and {DirectoriEs} ({DESDE}) tool, to describe service availability in eight urban and two rural health districts in Australia. The pattern of care was compared with that available for other age groups in Australia. Outpatient care was found to be the most common type of service provision, comprising 212 (81.2\%) of all services identified. Hospital care (acute and non-acute) was more available in urban than in rural areas (20 services [9.7\%] vs 1 [1.8\%]). The level of diversity in the types of care available for children and adolescents was lower than that for the general adult population, but slightly higher than that for older people in the same areas. Standardised comparison of the pattern of care across regions reduces ambiguity in service description and classification, enables gap analysis and can inform policy and planning. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Background Women's empowerment, education, and economic status are jointly introduced as women's 3E. A number of studies found the significant association of these three variables with maternal health outcomes, but no studies, to the best of knowledge, have been found to justify the joint influence of women's 3E on the birth interval. As several studies have revealed that the short birth interval increases the risk of adverse maternal, perinatal, and infant outcomes and it is also responsible for increasing the country's population size, more research is needed on the birth interval. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the influence of women's 3E on the short birth interval after controlling the other selected covariates. Methods Data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey ({BDHS}), 2017-18 have been used to serve the purpose of the study. To measure the birth interval, at least two live births for non-pregnant mothers and at least one live birth for currently pregnant mothers born in the 5 years before the survey were included in the study. The Chi-Square test was applied to know the unadjusted association of the selected covariates including women's 3E with the short birth interval. In order to find out the adjusted association of women's 3E with the short birth interval, sequential binary logistic regression models have been used. Results The study found that about 23\% of births in Bangladesh were born in a short birth interval. The likelihood of subsequent births of women decreases with an increase in the score of women's 3E before or after controlling the characteristics of women, child, and households. The results of the final model show that mothers with the coverage of 50\% - 75\%, 75\% - 100\%, and full coverage (100\%) in 3E have a 23\%, 41\%, and 42\% lower odds of having short birth interval compared to mothers with coverage of below 50\% in 3E, respectively. Conclusion and recommendation Bangladesh still lags behind in meeting the minimum requirements for inter-birth intervals set by the World Health Organization. The study has shown that the 3E in women can contribute in prolonging the duration of subsequent births in Bangladesh. Policy-making interventions are needed to raise awareness among uneducated, under-empowered and economically poor reproductive women through family planning and fertility control programs so that the country can achieve the desired fertility rate.  © 2022 Tuz-Zahura et al.

	abstract = {Background {WHO} pneumonia guidelines recommend that children (aged 2-59 months) with chest indrawing pneumonia and without any “general danger sign” can be treated with oral amoxicillin without hospital admission. This recommendation was based on trial data from limited contexts whose generalisability is unclear. This review aimed to identify which children with chest-indrawing pneumonia in low and middle-income countries can be safely treated at home, and under what conditions is it safe to do so. Methods We searched {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, and {PubMed} for observational and interventional studies of home-based management of children (aged 28 days to four years) with chest-indrawing pneumonia in low or middle-income countries. Results We included 14 studies, including seven randomised trials, from a variety of urban and rural contexts in 11 countries. Two community-based and two hospital-based trials in Pakistan and India found that home treatment of chest-indrawing pneumonia was associated with similar or superior treatment outcomes to hospital admission. Evidence from trials (n = 3) and observational (n = 6) studies in these and other countries confirms the acceptability and feasibility of home management of chest-indrawing pneumonia in low-risk cases, so long as safeguards are in place. Risk assessment includes clinical danger signs, oxygen saturation, and the presence of comorbidities such as undernutrition, anaemia, or {HIV}. Pulse oximetry is a critical risk-assessment tool that is currently not widely available and can identify severely ill patients with hypoxaemia otherwise possibly missed by clinical assessment alone. Additional safeguards include caregiver understanding and ability to return for review. Conclusions Home treatment of chest-indrawing pneumonia can be safe but should only be recommended for children confirmed to be low-risk and in contexts where appropriate care and safety measures are in place. © Health Organization [2021].

	abstract = {Background: Acute otitis media ({AOM}), or ear infection, is the most common reason for pediatric medical visits in the United States [1]. Additionally, transportation barriers are a significant driver of missed and delayed care across medical specialties [2,3]. Yet, the role of transportation barriers in impeding access for children with frequent ear infections ({FEI}) has not been investigated. Assessing the prevalence of transportation barriers across sociodemographic groups may help clinicians improve outcomes for children with {FEI}. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the U.S. National Health Interview Survey was completed to examine associations between sociodemographic characteristics among children with {FEI} and transportations barriers to seeking care between 2011 and 2018. Results: Multivariable logistic regression found that income level, insurance status, and health status were linked to disparities in transportation barriers among children with {FEI}. Those in the middle ({aOR} 3.00, 95\% {CI} 1.77–5.08, p {\textless} 0.001) and lowest income brackets ({aOR} 6.33, 95\% {CI} 3.80, p {\textless} 0.001), who were publicly insured ({aOR} 3.24, 95\% {CI} 2.00–5.23, p {\textless} 0.001) or uninsured ({aOR} 3.46, 95\% {CI} 1.84–6.51, p {\textless} 0.001), and with Poor to Fair health status were more likely to face transportation delays than patients who were in the highest income bracket, privately insured, or had Good to Excellent health status. Conclusion: Children with {FEI} from families that were lower-income, less insured, and less healthy faced more transportation barriers when accessing care than their counterparts. Future interventions to improve health-related transportation should be targeted toward these patient subgroups to reduce gaps in outcomes. © 2022},

	abstract = {Background: Unpreparedness of health professionals to address non-communicable diseases ({NCD}) at peripheral health facilities is a critical health system challenge in Mozambique. To address this weakness and decentralize {NCD} care, training of the primary care workforce is needed. We describe our experience in the design and implementation of a cascade training of trainers ({ToT}) intervention to strengthen the prevention and control of cardiovascular disease. Methods: Between October 2018 and March 2020 a multidisciplinary global technical partnership was used to train frontline primary care health professionals from a resource-poor suburban setting in Maputo, Mozambique. Following engagement with local policy makers, clinicians, and academics, core training materials were developed, and a {ToT} cascade was implemented, supported by an on-site pilot clinic. Knowledge and confidence acquisition by participants and new local trainers were assessed using pre- and post-training surveys, while trainees and trainers completed further evaluation surveys at the end of the program. Results: Three {ToT} workshops trained 60 mixed cadre healthcare workers in assessment, diagnosis and management of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk; of these, 11 became new local trainers. Mean pre- and post-test scores improved in all three training workshops (53\% to 90\%, 59\% to 78\%, and 58\% to 74\% respectively). New local trainers were highly rated by their trainees and reported increased confidence as trainers (mean Likert scale 3.0/5 pre-training to 4.8/5 post-training). Conclusion: This global health partnership delivered interprofessional training with good knowledge acquisition and increased self-reported confidence. Intensive local supervision and hands-on training empowered a new cohort of trainers to strengthen the prevention and control of cardiovascular disease and is likely to improve coordination and integration at primary care level as well as support the national scale up of {NCD} care delivery. © 2022 The Author(s).},

This became poignantly clear during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Currently, few sources exist which can provide canonical identification of healthcare facilities.

A health facility registry provides a central authority to store, manage, and share health facility identification, services, and resources data with a wide range of stakeholders. Such universal collection and standardization of these data may support care coordination, public health responsiveness, quality improvement, health services research, health service planning, and health policy development.

	abstract = {Background: In 2018, 875 000 under-five children died in India with children from poor families and rural communities disproportionately affected. Community health centres are positioned to improve access to quality child health services but capacity is often low and the systems for improvements are weak. Methods: Secondary analysis of child health program data from the Uttar Pradesh Technical Support Unit was used to delineate how program activities were temporally related to public facility readiness to provide child health services including inpatient admissions. Fifteen community health centres were mapped regarding capacity to provide child health services in July 2015. Mapped domains included human resources and training, infrastructure, equipment, drugs/supplies and child health services. Results were disseminated to district health managers. Six months following dissemination, Clinical Support Officers began regular supportive supervision and gaps were discussed monthly with health managers. Senior pediatric residents mentored medical officers over a three-month period. Improvements were assessed using a composite score of facility readiness for child health services in July 2016. Usage of outpatient and inpatient services by under-five children was also assessed. Results: The median essential composition score increased from 0.59 to 0.78 between July 2015 and July 2016 (maximum score of 1) and the median desirable composite increased from 0.44 to 0.58. The components contributing most to the change were equipment, drugs and supplies and service provision. Scores for trained human resources and infrastructure did not change between assessments. The number of facilities providing some admission services for sick children increased from 1 in July 2015 to 9 in October 2016. Conclusions: Facility readiness for the provision of child health services in Uttar Pradesh was improved with relatively low inputs and targeted assessment. However, these improvements were only translated into admissions for sick children when clinical mentoring was included in the support provided to facilities. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Effective surveillance and response systems are vital to achievement of disease control and elimination goals. Kenya adopted the revised guidelines of the integrated disease surveillance and response system in 2012. Previous assessments of surveillance system core and support functions in Africa are limited to notifiable diseases with minimal attention given to neglected tropical diseases amenable to preventive chemotherapy ({PC}-{NTDs}). The study aimed to assess surveillance system core and support functions relating to {PC}-{NTDs} in Kenya. Methods: A mixed method cross-sectional survey was adapted involving 192 health facility workers, 50 community-level health workers and 44 sub-national level health personnel. Data was collected using modified World Health Organization generic questionnaires, observation checklists and interview schedules. Descriptive summaries, tests of associations using Pearson’s Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests and mixed effects regression models were used to analyse quantitative data. Qualitative data derived from interviews with study participants were coded and analysed thematically. Results: Surveillance core and support functions in relation to {PC}-{NTDs} were assessed in comparison to an indicator performance target of 80\%. Optimal performance reported on specimen handling (84\%; 100\%), reports submission (100\%; 100\%) and data analysis (84\%; 80\%) at the sub-county and county levels respectively. Facilities achieved the threshold on reports submission (84\%), reporting deadlines (88\%) and feedback (80\%). However, low performance reported on case definitions availability (60\%), case registers (19\%), functional laboratories (52\%) and data analysis (58\%). Having well-equipped laboratories (3.07, 95\% {CI}: 1.36, 6.94), {PC}-{NTDs} provision in reporting forms (3.20, 95\% {CI}: 1.44, 7.10) and surveillance training (4.15, 95\% {CI}: 2.30, 7.48) were associated with higher odds of functional surveillance systems. Challenges facing surveillance activities implementation revealed through qualitative data were in relation to surveillance guidelines and reporting tools, data analysis, feedback, supervisory activities, training and resource provision. Conclusion: There was evidence of low-performing surveillance functions regarding {PC}-{NTDs} especially at the peripheral surveillance levels. Case detection, registration and confirmation, reporting, data analysis and feedback performed sub-optimally at the facility and community levels. Additionally, support functions including standards and guidelines, supervision, training and resources were particularly weak at the sub-national level. Improved {PC}-{NTDs} surveillance performance sub-nationally requires strengthened capacities. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Methods: Secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional study carried out in March 2016, using both quantitative and qualitative methods to collect data in five counties based on set criteria. Three health facilities were selected in each county through the Health Management Information System ({HMIS}) by random sampling. The evaluation was also carried out in one catchment community per health facility and at the county referral hospital. Primary data were collected through individual interviews and a review of {MNDSR} tools and structure. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Implementation of the {MNDSR} system was very low in the five counties. Only two out of the five counties were currently conducting {MNDSR}. {MNDSR} guidelines and standard operating procedures were not available at the county level. Only 12 (23.5\%) health facilities had a maternal and neonatal death review committee. Less than a quarter of the assessed community members could correctly give the definition of a maternal or neonatal death. Conclusion: The {MNDSR} system is weak in Liberia, at county, health facility, and community levels.

	abstract = {Background Improved access to and quality obstetric care in health facilities reduces maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. We examined spatial patterns, within-country wealth-related inequalities and predictors of inequality in skilled birth attendance and caesarean deliveries in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We analysed the most recent Demographic and Health Survey data from 25 sub-Saharan African countries. We used the concentration index to measure within-country wealth-related inequality in skilled birth attendance and caesarean section. We fitted a multilevel Poisson regression model to identify predictors of inequality in having skilled attendant at birth and caesarean section. Results The rate of skilled birth attendance ranged from 24.3\% in Chad to 96.7\% in South Africa. The overall coverage of caesarean delivery was 5.4\% (95\% {CI} 5.2\% to 5.6\%), ranging from 1.4\% in Chad to 24.2\% in South Africa. The overall wealth-related absolute inequality in having a skilled attendant at birth was extremely high, with a difference of 46.2 percentage points between the poorest quintile (44.4\%) and the richest quintile (90.6\%). In 10 out of 25 countries, the caesarean section rate was less than 1\% among the poorest quintile, but the rate was more than 15\% among the richest quintile in nine countries. Four or more antenatal care contacts, improved maternal education, higher household wealth status and frequently listening to the radio increased the rates of having skilled attendant at birth and caesarean section. Women who reside in rural areas and those who have to travel long distances to access health facilities were less likely to have skilled attendant at birth or caesarean section. Conclusions There were significant within-country wealth-related inequalities in having skilled attendant at birth and caesarean delivery. Efforts to improve access to birth at the facility should begin in areas with low coverage and directly consider the needs and experiences of vulnerable populations. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

	abstract = {Background Non-adherence to the maternal continuum of care remains a significant challenge. Though early initiation and continuum of care are recommended for mothers’ and newborns’ well-being, there is a paucity of evidence that clarify this condition in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to assess the level of women’s completion of the maternal continuum of care and factors affecting it in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from October to November, 2020. Data were collected from 811 women who had a recent history of birth within the past one year. The random and fixed effects were reported using an adjusted odds ratio with a 95\% confidence interval. The p-value of 0.05 was used to declare significantly associated factors with women’s completion of the maternal continuum of care. Results The study revealed that 6.9\% (95\%{CI}: 5.3–8.9\%) of women were retained fully on the continuum of maternal care, while 7.89\% of women did not receive any care from the existing healthcare system. Attending secondary and above education ({AOR} = 3.15; 95\%{CI}: 1.25,7.89), membership in the women’s development army ({AOR} = 2.91; 95\%{CI}: 1.56,5.44); being insured ({AOR} = 2.59; 95\%{CI}: 1.33,5.01); getting health education ({AOR} = 2.44; 95\%{CI}: 1.33,4.45); short distance to health facility ({AOR} = 4.81; 95\%{CI}: 1.55,14.95); and mass-media exposure ({AOR} = 2.39; 95\%{CI}: 1.11,5.15) were significantly associated with maternal continuum of care. Conclusions The maternal continuum of care is low in rural northwest Ethiopia compared to findings from most resource-limited settings. Therefore, the existing health system should consider multilevel intervention strategies that focus on providing maternal health education, facilitating insurance mechanisms, encouraging women’s participation in health clubs, and ensuring physical accessibility to healthcare facilities to be more effective in improving maternal health services. © 2022 Hailemariam et al.

	abstract = {Background: Health practitioners and researchers must be able to measure and assess maternal care quality in facilities to monitor, intervene, and reduce global maternal mortality rates. On the global scale, there is a general lack of consensus on how maternal care quality is defined, conceptualized, and measured. Much of the literature addressing this problem has focused primarily on defining, conceptualizing, and measuring clinical indicators of maternal care quality. Less attention has been given in this regard to perceived maternal care quality among women which is known to influence care utilization and adherence. Therefore, there is a need to map the literature focused on defining, conceptualizing, and measuring perceived maternal care quality across low-, middle-, and high-income country contexts. Methods: This scoping review protocol will follow the Arksey and O’Malley methodological framework. A comprehensive search strategy will be used to search for articles published from inception to 2020 in Ovid {MEDLINE}, Embase, {AMED}, and {WHO} Global Index Medicus. Gray literature will be included. Two independent reviewers will screen articles by title and abstract, then by full-text based on pre-determined inclusion/exclusion criteria. A third reviewer will arbitrate any discrepancies. This protocol outlines a four-step analytic approach that includes numerical, graphical, tabular, and narrative summaries to provide a comprehensive description of the body of literature. Discussion: The findings from this scoping review will provide a comprehensive overview of the existing evidence on perceived maternal care quality. The findings are expected to inform future work on building consensus around the definition and conceptualization of perceived maternal care quality, and lay the groundwork for future research aimed at developing measures of perceived maternal care quality that can be applied across country contexts. Consequently, this review may aid in facilitating coordinated efforts to measure and improve maternal care quality across diverse country contexts (i.e., low-, middle-, and high-income country contexts).

	abstract = {Background and aims: This study aimed to examine perspectives of patients, health professionals, and policymakers on current practices and their future preferences for type 2 diabetes care in a tertiary hospital in Ethiopia. Methods: An exploratory qualitative study was undertaken through interviews and focus groups with patients, health professionals, and policymakers. The participants were purposively sampled. Thematic analysis was undertaken. Results: Fifty-nine participants were involved in the study. Participants' perspectives on current practices and future preferences comprised three themes: organisation of type 2 diabetes care delivery and infrastructure; continuity of care; and structured diabetes education. The current organisation comprised physicians, such as endocrinologists and endocrinology fellows, and nurses. Some nurses received training on diabetes foot and diabetic eye, which enabled patients to receive diabetes foot and diabetic eye care, respectively. The hospital lacked essential resources, such as medications, laboratory and diagnostic services, and diabetes educators, which hindered patient-centred care. Patients complained that the physical set-up at the hospital was not conducive to their privacy during consultations. Participants reported infrequent patient follow-up and monitoring, which contributed to uncontrolled diabetes. Future preferences involved access to essential resources and comprehensive diabetes care, such as structured diabetes education for improved patient outcomes. Participants sought out the development of tailored and context-specific diabetes management approaches that could meet specific patient needs and preferences. Conclusions: The findings have implications for designing patient-centred diabetes care tailored to the hospital's context and key stakeholders' preferences. This tailoring requires strong leadership to ensure availability of essential resources. © 2022 Diabetes India},

	abstract = {Background The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) pandemic has disrupted essential health services globally. {COVID}-19 related disruptions threaten malaria control and elimination as untreated and inappropriately treated malaria cases can lead to excess mortality and impede the {COVID}-19 response. This study characterized malaria service provision during the pandemic in Manicaland Province, Zimbabwe. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in randomly selected health facilities in Buhera, Makoni, and Mutare districts in August 2020. Data on the provision of malaria services, the availability of infection prevention control measures and the display of {COVID}-19 related information, education, and communication ({IEC}) materials were collected using a standardized questionnaire. Descriptive analyses by facility type, managing authority, and district were used. Results A total of 100 health facilities were surveyed and most were publicly managed health centers and clinics. 5\% of health facilities reported testing for {COVID}-19, 3\% reported {COVID}-19 related health worker absences and 1\% reported disruptions to any essential health services. About two-thirds (67\%) of facilities displayed {COVID}-19 related {IEC} materials and 75\% had infection prevention control measures available. Despite inequities in malaria readiness by managing authority, district, and type of facility, 70\% of facilities were considered “ready” to provide malaria services. Conclusions Malaria services were fairly available with very few {COVID}-19 related disruptions to essential health services. Maintaining essential malaria services remains crucial in preventing excess malaria morbidity and mortality. © 2022, International Society of Global Health. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Mistreatment in childbirth is institutionalized in many healthcare settings globally, causing widespread harm. Rising concern has elicited research on its prevalence and characteristics, with limited attention to developing explanatory theory. Mistreatment, a complex systemic and behavioral phenomenon, requires social science theory to explain its persistence despite official norms that promote respectful care. Diane Vaughan's normalization of organizational deviance theory from organizational sociology emerged from studies of how things go wrong in organizations. Its multi-level framework provided an opportunity for analogical cross-case comparison to elaborate theory on mistreatment as normalized organizational deviance. To elaborate the theory, the Tanzanian public health system in the period of 2010-2015 was selected as a case. A broad Scopus search identified 4068 articles published on the health system and maternal health in Tanzania of which 122 were selected. Data was extracted using a framework based on the theory and reviews of mistreatment in healthcare. Relationships and patterns emerged through comparative analysis across concepts and system levels and then were compared with Vaughan's theory and additional organizational theories. Analysis revealed that normalized scarcity at the macro-level combined with production pressures for biomedical care and imbalanced power-dependence altered values, structures and processes in the health system. Meso-level actors struggled to achieve production goals with limited autonomy and resources, resulting in workarounds and informal rationing. Biomedical care was prioritized, and emotion work was rationed in provider interactions with women, which many women experienced as disrespect. Analogical comparison with another case of organizational deviance based on literature enabled a novel approach to elaborate theory. The emergent theory sheds light on opportunities to transform systems and routinize respectful care. Theory application in additional settings and exploration of other social theories is needed for further understanding of this complex problem.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {Background: This study aims to assess the {COVID}-19 response preparedness of the Mozambican health system by 1) determining the location of oxygen-ready public health facilities, 2) estimating the oxygen treatment capacity, and 3) determining the population coverage of oxygen-ready health facilities in Mozambique. Methods: This analysis utilizes information on the availability of oxygen sources and delivery apparatuses to determine if a health facility is ready to deliver oxygen therapy to patients in need, and estimates how many patients can be treated with continuous oxygen flow for a 7-day period based on the available oxygen equipment at health facilities. Using {GIS} mapping software, the study team modeled varying travel times to oxygen-ready facilities to estimate the proportion of the population with access to care. Results: 0.4\% of all health facilities in Mozambique are prepared to deliver oxygen therapy to patients, for a cumulative total of 283.9 to 406.0 patients-weeks given the existing national capacity, under varying assumptions including ability to divert oxygen from a single source to multiple patients. 35\% of the population in Mozambique has adequate access within one-hour driving time of an oxygen-ready health facility. This varies widely by region; 89.1\% of the population of Maputo City was captured by the one-hour driving time network, as compared ot 4.4\% of the population of Niassa province. Conclusions: The Mozambican health system faces the dual challenges of under-resourced health facilities and low geographic accessibility to healthcare as it prepares to confront the {COVID}-19 pandemic. This analysis also illustrates the disparity between provinces in preparedness to deliver oxygen therapy to patient, with Cabo Delgado and Nampula being particularly under-resourced. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: {SMS} for Life was one of the earliest large-scale implementations of {mHealth} innovations worldwide. Its goal was to increase visibility to antimalarial stock-outs through the use of {SMS} technology. The objective of this case study was to show the multiple innovations that {SMS} for Life brought to the Tanzanian public health sector and to discuss the challenges of scaling up that led to its discontinuation from a health systems perspective. Methods: A qualitative case-study approach was used. This included a literature review, a document review of 61 project documents, a timeline of key events and the collection and analysis of 28 interviews with key stakeholders involved in or affected by the {SMS} for Life programme. Data collection was informed by the health system building blocks. We then carried out a thematic analysis using the {WHO} {mHealth} Assessment and Planning for Scale ({MAPS}) Toolkit as a framework. This served to identify the key reasons for the discontinuation of the programme. Results: {SMS} for Life was reliable at scale and raised awareness of stock-outs with real-time monitoring. However, it was discontinued in 2015 after 4 years of a national rollout. The main reasons identified for the discontinuation were the programme’s failure to adapt to the continuous changes in Tanzania’s health system, the focus on stock-outs rather than ensuring appropriate stock management, and that it was perceived as costly by policy-makers. Despite its discontinuation, {SMS} for Life, together with co-existing technologies, triggered the development of the capacity to accommodate and integrate future technologies in the health system. Conclusion: This study shows the importance of engaging appropriate stakeholders from the outset, understanding and designing system-responsive interventions appropriately when scaling up and ensuring value to a broad range of health system actors. These shortcomings are common among digital health solutions and need to be better addressed in future implementations. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The paper is dedicated to the problem of computational urban science to estimate availability of urban services with limited capacity. The applied side of the problem is related to the need to assess the provision of citizens living in residential buildings in the city with a sufficient number of places of city services, such as kindergartens, schools, clinics, and others. This information is necessary for the qualitative management of the socio-economic and spatial development of the city. The computational complexity of the problem is associated with a great variety of factors that determine the variability of the citizens' preference function when accessing a particular service. It is further complicated by the presence of self-organization processes within this system, which lead to the actual final satisfaction of the citizens' service demand but with significant deviations from the required parameters of service availability established in regulatory documents or the optimal state of the system. Since validation of such models for large cities is difficult or impossible, this requires the development of new computational approaches for assessing the provision of the population with urban services based on the optimal state of the system to improve the efficiency of city management. A proposed algorithm is based on sequential aggregation of the demand from buildings for each service object and redistribution of unserved demand between other services objects with free capacity. This approach avoids high computational complexity which arises when using nonlinear programming to calculate buildings' provision of services in large cities. The article presents the algorithm for calculating the provision of the population and demonstrates its application on the data of the city of St. Petersburg. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

We assessed the readiness of Zanzibar health facilities and districts for early detection and management of mosquito-borne viral disease outbreaks. Methods: A cross-sectional study involving all 10 District Health Management Teams and 45 randomly selected public and private health facilities in Zanzibar was conducted using a mixed-methods approach including observations, document review, and structured interviews with health facility in-charges and District Health Management Team members. Results: The readiness of the Zanzibar healthcare system for timely detection, management, and control of dengue and other mosquito-borne viral disease outbreaks was critically low. The majority of health facilities and districts lacked the necessary requirements including standard guidelines, trained staff, real-time data capture, analysis and reporting systems, as well as laboratory diagnostic capacity. In addition, health education programmes for creating public awareness and Aedes mosquito surveillance and control activities were non-existent. Conclusions: The Zanzibar healthcare system has limited readiness for management, and control of mosquito-borne viral diseases. In light of impending epidemics, the critical shortage of skilled human resource, lack of guidelines, lack of effective disease and vector surveillance and control measures as well as lack of laboratory capacity at all levels of health facilities require urgent attention across the Zanzibar archipelago. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction: access to essential secondary and tertiary healthcare, including surgery and medical sub-specialties, is a challenge in low-and-middle income countries ({LMICs}), especially for displaced populations. Referrals from refugee camps are highly regulated and may pose barriers to accessing essential secondary healthcare in a timely manner. Refugee referral systems and the ways they interact with national systems are poorly understood. Such information is necessary for resource allocation and prioritization, optimizing patient outcomes, national-level planning, and investment in capacity-building. Methods: a retrospective review of referrals from Nyarugusu Refugee Camp in Tanzania to Kabanga Hospital between January 2016-May 2017 was conducted. Data was collected from logbooks on patient demographics, diagnosis, and reason for referral. Diagnoses and reasons for referral were further coded by organ system and specific referral codes, respectively. Results: there were 751 entries in the referral logbook between January 2016 and May 2017. Of these, 79 (10.5\%) were excluded as they were caretakers or missing both diagnoses and reason for referral resulting in 672 (89.5\%) total entries for analysis.The most common organ system of diagnosis was musculoskeletal (171, 25.5\%) followed by head, ear, eye, nose and throat (n=164, 24.4\%) and infectious disease (n=92, 13.7\%). The most common reason for referral was imaging (n=250, 37.2\%) followed by need for a specialist (n=214, 31.9\%) and further management (n=116, 17.3\%). X-ray comprised the majority of imaging referred (n=249, 99.6\%). The most common specialties referred to were ophthalmology (n=104, 48.6\%) followed by surgery (n=63, 29.4\%), and otolaryngology ({ENT}) (n=17, 7.9\%). Conclusion: given a large burden of referral for refugee patients and sharing of in and out-of-camp healthcare facilities with nationals, refugees should be included in national health care plans and have clear referral processes. Epidemiological data that include these intertwined referral patterns are necessary to promote efficient resource allocation, reduce unnecessary referrals, and prevent delays in care that could affect patient outcomes. International agencies, {NGOs}, and governments should conduct cost analyses to explore innovative capacity-building projects for secondary care in camp-based facilities. © Orit Abrahim et al.},

	abstract = {Background and aim Globally, 12.8 million children have vision impairment due to uncorrected refractive error ({URE}). In Mongolia, one in five children needs but do not have access to spectacles. This pilot cost-benefit analysis aims to estimate the net benefits of a children's spectacles reimbursement scheme in Mongolia. Methods A willingness-to-pay ({WTP}) survey using the contingent valuation method was administered to rural and urban Mongolia respondents. The survey assessed {WTP} in additional annual taxes for any child with refractive error to be provided government-subsidised spectacles. Net benefits were then calculated based on mean {WTP} (i.e. benefit) and cost of spectacles. Results The survey recruited 50 respondents (mean age 40.2 ± 9.86 years; 78.0\% women; 100\% response rate) from rural and urban Mongolia. Mean {WTP} was {US}\$24.00 ± 5.15 (95\% {CI} {US}\$22.55 to 25.35). The average cost of a pair of spectacles in Mongolia is {US}\$15.00. Subtracting the average cost of spectacles from mean {WTP} yielded a mean positive net benefit of {US}\$9.00. Conclusion A spectacle reimbursement scheme is potentially a cost-effective intervention to address childhood vision impairment due to {URE} in Mongolia. These preliminary findings support the proposal of the inclusion of children's spectacles into existing Social Health Insurance. A much larger random sample could be employed in future research to increase the precision and generalisability of findings.  © 2022 Yong et al.

	abstract = {Background: Adverse pregnancy outcomes jointly account for a high proportion of mortality and morbidity among pregnant women and their infants. Furthermore, the burden attributed to adverse pregnancy outcomes remains high and inadequately characterised due to the intricate interplay of its etiology and shared set of important risk factors. This study sought to quantify and map the underlying risk of multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes in Kenya at sub-county level using a shared component space-time modelling framework. Methods: Reported sub-county level adverse pregnancy outcomes count from January 2016 – December 2019 were obtained from the Kenyan District Health Information System. A Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model was used to estimate the joint burden of adverse pregnancy outcomes in space (sub-county) and time (year). To improve the precision of our estimates over time and space, information across the outcomes were combined via the shared and the outcome-specific components using a shared component model with spatio-temporal interactions. Results: Overall, the total number of adverse outcomes in pregnancy increased by 14.2\% (95\% {UI}: 14.0–14.5) from 88,816 cases in 2016 to 101,455 cases in 2019. Between 2016 and 2019, the estimated low birth weight rate and the pre-term birth rate were 4.5 (95\% {UI}: 4.4–4.7) and 2.3 (95\% {UI}: 2.2–2.5) per 100 live births. The stillbirth and neonatal death rates were estimated to be 18.7 (95\% {UI}: 18.0–19.4) and 6.9 (95\% {UI}: 6.4–7.4) per 1000 live births. The magnitude of the spatio-temporal variation attributed to shared risk was high for pre-term births, low birth weight, neonatal deaths, stillbirths and neonatal deaths, respectively. The shared risk patterns were dominant in sub-counties located along the Indian ocean coastline, central and western Kenya. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the usefulness of a Bayesian joint spatio-temporal shared component model in exploiting specific and shared risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes sub-nationally. By identifying sub-counties with elevated risks and data gaps, our estimates not only assert the need for bolstering maternal health programs in the identified high-risk sub-counties but also provides a baseline against which to assess the progress towards the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals. © 2021, The Author(s).},

However, despite the number of interventional studies on the treatment of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combination ({IPTp}-{SP}) uptake, the point in point cases of the positive responses of {ANC} in improving health conditions of pregnant women are not found in the literature. Data sources: This review collected {ANC} responses to the positive health outcomes for pregnant women with malaria, the challenges faced regarding {IPTp}-{SP} uptake during {ANC} visits and the role of {ANC} in preventing and controlling malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. It elucidated {ANC} and uptake of optimal intermittent preventive {IPTp}-{SP} and further described {ANC} as a tool for heterogeneity for malaria prevention. Results: {ANC} is seen as a microscope to malaria in pregnacy, maternal iron deficiency and anemia checkpoints, {ANC} and malaria treatment strategies, and {ANC} and the use of insecticide treated nets ({ITN}). The review further discussed {ANC} attendance influencing factors, limitations to {ANC} implications and the prospects in {ANC} visits on preventing malaria in pregnancy.

	abstract = {Background: Antibiotic resistance is a threat to global child health. Primary healthcare workers play a key role in antibiotic stewardship in the community, but few studies in low-income countries have described their experiences of initiating antibiotic treatment in children. Thus, the present study aimed to describe primary healthcare workers’ experiences of antibiotic prescription for children under 5 years of age and their conceptions of antibiotic resistance in Northern Tanzania. Methods: A qualitative study involving individual in-depth interviews with 20 prescribing primary healthcare workers in Moshi urban and rural districts, Northern Tanzania, was performed in 2019. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, translated from Kiswahili into English and analysed according to the phenomenographic approach. Findings: Four conceptual themes emerged during the analysis; conceptions in relation to the prescriber, the mother and child, other healthcare actors and in relation to outcome. The healthcare workers relied mainly on clinical examination and medical history provided by the mother to determine the need for antibiotics. Confidence in giving advice concerning non-antibiotic treatment varied among the participants and expectations of antibiotic treatment were perceived to be common among the mothers. Antibiotic resistance was mainly perceived as a problem for the individual patient who was misusing the antibiotics. Conclusions: To increase rational antibiotic prescription, an awareness needs to be raised among Tanzanian primary healthcare workers of the threat of antibiotic resistance, not only to a few individuals, but to public health. Guidelines on childhood illnesses should be updated with advice concerning symptomatic treatment when antibiotics are not necessary, to support rational prescribing practices and promote trust in the clinician and mother relationship. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Maternal mortality is still unacceptably high in Kenya. The Kenyan Government introduced a free maternity service to overcome financial barriers to access. This policy led to a substantial increase in women’s delivery options. This increase in coverage might have led to a reduction in quality of care. This study explores women’s perceptions of quality of delivery services in the context of the free policy and how the perceptions lead to the choice of a place for delivery. Methods: Our study site was Naivasha sub-County in Kenya, a rural context, whose geography encompasses pastoralists, rural agrarian, and high population density informal settlements near flower farms. Women from this area are from the lowest wealth quintile in Kenya. We conducted a qualitative study to explore the women’s perceptions of quality of care based on their experiences during maternity care. The participants were women of reproductive age (18–49 years) attending antenatal care clinics at six health facilities in the sub-county. Six focus group discussions with 55 respondents were used. For inclusion, the women needed to have delivered a baby within the six months preceding the study. Interviews were recorded with consent, translated and transcribed. The interviews were analyzed using a thematic content approach. Results: Four broad themes that determined the choice of health facility for delivery were identified: women’s perceptions of clinical quality of care; the cost of delivery; distance to the health facility and management of primary health facilities. An unexpected theme was the presence of home deliveries amongst pastoralist women. These findings suggest that in this setting both process and structural dimensions of quality of care and financial and physical accessibility influence women’s choices for place of delivery. Conclusion: This study expands our understanding of how women make choices regarding place of delivery. Understanding women’s perceptions can provide useful insights to policy makers and facility managers on providing high quality patient centered maternity care necessary to sustain the increased utilization of maternity services at health facilities under the free maternity policy and further reductions in maternal mortality. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, {LLC}, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background Despite Burundi having formed a network of 112 health facilities that provide emergency obstetric and neonatal care ({EmONC}), the country continues to struggle with high rates of maternal and newborn deaths. There is a dearth of empirical evidence on the capacity and performance of {EmONC} health facilities and on the real needs to inform proper planning and policy. Our study aims to generate evidence on the capacity and performance of {EmONC} health facilities in Burundi and examine how the country might develop an appropriate skilled delivery care workforce to improve maternal and newborn survival. Methods We will use a sequential design where each study phase serially inputs into the subsequent phase. Three main study phases will be carried out: i) an initial policy document review to explore global norms and local policy intentions for {EmONC} staffing and ii) a cross-sectional survey of all {EmONC} health facilities to determine what percent of facilities are functional including geographic and population coverage gaps, identify staffing gaps assessed against norms, and identify other needs for health facility strengthening. Finally, we will conduct surveys in selected schools and ministries to examine training and staffing costs to inform staffing options that might best promote service delivery with adequate budget impacts to increase efficiency. Throughout the study, we will engage stakeholders to provide input into what are reasonable staffing norms as well as feasible staffing alternatives within Burundi's budget capacity. Analytical models will be used to develop staffing proposals over a realistic policy timeline. Conclusion Evidence-based health planning improves cost-effectiveness and reduces wastage within scarce and resource-constrained contexts. This study will be the first large-scale research in Burundi that builds on stakeholder support to generate evidence on the capacity of designated {EmONC} health facilities including human resources diagnosis and develop staffing skill-mix tradeoffs for policy discussion. © 2022 Habonimana D et al.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The ministry of health ({MOH}) of Ethiopia recommends 4 or more focused antenatal care ({ANC}) visits at health centre ({HC}) or at a higher level of health facility ({HF}). In Ethiopia, few studies investigated time dimension of maternal health continuum of care but lack data regarding place dimension and its effect on continuum of care. The aim of this study is to estimate effect of place of {ANC}-1 visit and adherence to {MOH}’s recommendations of {MOH} for {ANC} visits on continuum of care rural in Ethiopia. Methods: We used data collected from 1431 eligible women included in the National Health Extension Program ({HEP}) assessment survey that covered 6324 households from 62 woredas in nine regions. The main outcome variable is continuum of care ({CoC}), which is the uptake of all recommended {ANC} visits, institutional delivery and postnatal care services. Following descriptive analysis, Propensity Score Matching was used to estimate the effect of place of {ANC}-1 visit on completion of {CoC}. Zero inflated Poisson regression was used to model the effect of adherence to {MOH} recommendation of {ANC} visits on intensity of maternal health continuum of care. Result: Only 13.9\% of eligible women completed the continuum of care, and place of first antenatal care ({ANC}) visit was not significantly associated with the completion of continuum of care (β = 0.04, 95\% {CI} = -0.02, 0.09). Adherence of {ANC} visit to the {MOH} recommendation (at least 4 {ANC} visits at higher {HFs} than health posts ({HPs})) increased the likelihood of higher intensity of continuum of care ({aIRR} = 1.29, 95\% {CI}: 1.26, 1.33). Moreover, the intensity of continuum of care was positively associated with being in agrarian areas ({aIRR} = 1.17, 95\% {CI}: 1.06, 1.29), exposed to {HEP} ({IRR} = 1.22, 95\% {CI}: 1.16, 1.28), being informed about danger signs ({aIRR} = 1.14, 95\% {CI}: 1.11, 1.18) and delivery of second youngest child at {HF} ({IRR} = 1.16, 95\% {CI}: 1.13, 1.20). Increasing age of women was negatively associated with use of services ({IRR} = 0.90, 95\% {CI}: 0.87, 0.94). Conclusion: Completion of maternal health continuum of care is very low in Ethiopia, however most of the women use at least one of the services. Completion of continuum of care was not affected by place of first {ANC} visit. Adherence to {MOH} recommendation of {ANC} visit increased the intensity of continuum of care. Intensity of continuum of care was positively associated with residing in agrarian areas, {HEP} exposure, danger sign told, delivery of second youngest child at health facility. To boost the uptake of all maternal health services, it is crucial to work on quality of health facilities, upgrading the infrastructures of {HPs} and promoting adherence to {MOH} recommendations of {ANC} visit. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objectives Globally, hundreds of women die daily from preventable pregnancy-related causes, with the greatest burden in sub-Saharan Africa. Five key emergencies - bleeding, infections, high blood pressure, delivery complications and unsafe abortions - account for nearly 75\% of these obstetric deaths. Skilled clinicians with strategic supplies could prevent most deaths. In this study, we (1) measured facility readiness to manage common obstetric emergencies using the clinical cascades and signal function tracers; (2) compared these readiness estimates by facility characteristics; and (3) measured cascading drop-offs in resources. Design A facility-based cross-sectional analysis of resources for common obstetric emergencies. Setting Data were collected in 2016 from 23 hospitals (10 designated comprehensive emergency obstetric care ({CEmOC}) facilities) in Migori County, western Kenya, and Busoga Region, eastern Uganda, in the Preterm Birth Initiative study in East Africa. Baseline data were used to estimate a facility's readiness to manage common obstetric emergencies using signal function tracers and the clinical cascade model. We compared emergency readiness using the proportion of facilities with tracers (signal functions) and the proportion with resources for identifying and treating the emergency (cascade stages 1 and 2). Results The signal functions overestimated practical emergency readiness by 23 percentage points across five emergencies. Only 42\% of {CEmOC}-designated facilities could perform basic emergency obstetric care. Across the three stages of care (identify, treat and monitor-modify) for five emergencies, there was a 28\% pooled mean drop-off in readiness. Across emergencies, the largest drop-off occurred in the treatment stage. Patterns of drop-off remained largely consistent across facility characteristics. Conclusions Accurate measurement of obstetric emergency readiness is a prerequisite for strengthening facilities' capacity to manage common emergencies. The cascades offer stepwise, emergency-specific readiness estimates designed to guide targeted maternal survival policies and programmes.

	abstract = {Introduction This study aimed to build the emergent body of evidence of family planning and maternal and child health ({FPMCH}) service integration benefits that can be useful in reaching the target of sustainable development goals ({SDGs}). Methods We utilized data from the 2015 Nepal Health Facility Survey and used the World Health Organization service readiness manual for defining the service readiness indicator score of all services related to {FPMCH} integration. Composite readiness index for all services including family planning, antenatal care service, delivery and newborn service readiness index, and curative child care service readiness index was considered for the integration of all services (i.e. readiness for {FPMCH}). Multivariable linear regression models were fitted to examine the association between covariates and readiness score to provide integrated services. Results The mean readiness score of integrated services in health facilities in Nepal was 52.1\%. The services in private hospitals and peripheral health facilities had significantly lower readiness scores of integrated services compared to government hospitals. Compared to Province 3(Province 3 holds the national capital), Province 2 had significantly lower and Province 7 had significantly higher readiness scores. There is a marginally significantly higher readiness score of integrated services in the facilities where management meetings are held compared to where management meetings are never conducted. Interestingly, health facilities where external supervision occurred in the last 4 months had better service readiness of integrated services compared with those facilities with no external supervision. Similarly, the facilities that performed the routine quality assurance activities and facilities having a system for collecting opinion and being reviewed had a higher integrated services readiness score than their counterparts. Conclusion This study found a scope of improvement in management practices in the health sector of Nepal especially for supportive supervision, quality assurance ({QA}) activities, monthly management meetings, and a system of collecting and reviewing opinions from the clients. Strengthening management practices especially, promoting supportive supervision and adhering to {QA} protocols may improve {HF} readiness to implement integrated {FPMCH} in Nepal. Being low readiness, there is an urgent need for policy reform to improve the integrated service readiness, particularly in Province 2. © 2022 Acharya et al.

	abstract = {Most countries have made little progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goal ({SDG}) target 3.4, which calls for a reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases ({NCDs}) by a third from 2015 to 2030. In this Health Policy paper, we synthesise the evidence related to interventions that can reduce premature mortality from the major {NCDs} over the next decade and that are feasible to implement in countries at all levels of income. Our recommendations are intended as generic guidance to help 123 low-income and middle-income countries meet {SDG} target 3.4; country-level applications require additional analyses and consideration of the local implementation and utilisation context. Protecting current investments and scaling up these interventions is especially crucial in the context of {COVID}-19-related health system disruptions. We show how cost-effectiveness data and other information can be used to define locally tailored packages of interventions to accelerate rates of decline in {NCD} mortality. Under realistic implementation constraints, most countries could achieve (or almost achieve) the {NCD} target using a combination of these interventions; the greatest gains would be for cardiovascular disease mortality. Implementing the most efficient package of interventions in each world region would require, on average, an additional {US}\$18 billion annually over 2023–30; this investment could avert 39 million deaths and generate an average net economic benefit of \$2·7 trillion, or \$390 per capita. Although specific clinical intervention pathways would vary across countries and regions, policies to reduce behavioural risks, such as tobacco smoking, harmful use of alcohol, and excess sodium intake, would be relevant in nearly every country, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the health gains of any locally tailored {NCD} package. By 2030, ministries of health would need to contribute about 20\% of their budgets to high-priority {NCD} interventions. Our report concludes with a discussion of financing and health system implementation considerations and reflections on the {NCD} agenda beyond the {SDG} target 3.4 and beyond the {SDG} period. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Introduction Mental, neurological and substance use conditions lead to tremendous suffering, yet globally access to effective care is limited. In line with the 13th General Programme of Work ({GPW} 13), in 2019 the World Health Organization ({WHO}) launched the {WHO} Special Initiative for Mental Health: Universal Health Coverage for Mental Health to advance mental health policies, advocacy, and human rights and to scale up access to quality and affordable care for people living with mental health conditions. Six countries were selected as 'early-adopter' countries for the {WHO} Special Initiative for Mental Health in the initial phase. Our objective was to rapidly and comprehensively assess the strength of mental health systems in each country with the goal of informing national priority-setting at the outset of the Initiative. Methods We used a modified version of the Program for Improving Mental Health Care ({PRIME}) situational analysis tool. We used a participatory process to document national demographic and population health characteristics; environmental, sociopolitical, and health-related threats; the status of mental health policies and plans; the prevalence of mental disorders and treatment coverage; and the availability of resources for mental health. Results Each country had distinct needs, though several common themes emerged. Most were dealing with crises with serious implications for population mental health. None had sufficient mental health services to meet their needs. All aimed to decentralize and deinstitutionalize mental health services, to integrate mental health care into primary health care, and to devote more financial and human resources to mental health systems. All cited insufficient and inequitably distributed specialist human resources for mental health as a major impediment. Conclusions This rapid assessment facilitated priority-setting for mental health system strengthening by national stakeholders. Next steps include convening design workshops in each country and initiating monitoring and evaluation procedures. Copyright: © 2022 Kemp et al.

	abstract = {Background The {COVID}-19 pandemic has overwhelmed health systems in both developed and developing nations alike. Africa has one of the weakest health systems globally, but there is limited evidence on how the region is prepared for, impacted by and responded to the pandemic. Methods We conducted a scoping review of {PubMed}, Scopus, {CINAHL} to search peer-reviewed articles and Google, Google Scholar and preprint sites for grey literature. The scoping review captured studies on either preparedness or impacts or responses associated with {COVID}-19 or covering one or more of the three topics and guided by Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework. The extracted information was documented following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension checklist for scoping reviews. Finally, the resulting data were thematically analysed. Results Twenty-two eligible studies, of which 6 reported on health system preparedness, 19 described the impacts of {COVID}-19 on access to general and essential health services and 7 focused on responses taken by the healthcare systems were included. The main setbacks in health system preparation included lack of available health services needed for the pandemic, inadequate resources and equipment, and limited testing ability and surge capacity for {COVID}-19. Reduced flow of patients and missing scheduled appointments were among the most common impacts of the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Health system responses identified in this review included the availability of telephone consultations, re-purposing of available services and establishment of isolation centres, and provisions of {COVID}-19 guidelines in some settings. Conclusions The health systems in Africa were inadequately prepared for the pandemic, and its impact was substantial. Responses were slow and did not match the magnitude of the problem. Interventions that will improve and strengthen health system resilience and financing through local, national and global engagement should be prioritised.  © 2021 Author(s).},

Objectives: To identify the essential components of {ANC} and develop signal functions. Search strategy: {MESH} headings for databases including Cinahl, Cochrane, Global Health, Medline, {PubMed} and Web of Science. Selection criteria: Papers and reports on content of {ANC} published from 2000 to 2020. Data collection and analysis: Narrative synthesis of data and development of signal function through 7 consensus-building workshops with 184 stakeholders. Main results: A total of 221 papers and reports are included from which 28 essential components of {ANC} were extracted and used to develop 15 signal functions with the equipment, medication and consumables required for implementation of each. Signal functions for the prevention and management of infectious diseases (malaria, {HIV}, tuberculosis, syphilis and tetanus) can be applied depending on population disease burden. Screening and management of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, anaemia, mental and social health (including intimate partner violence) are recommended universally. Three signal functions address monitoring of fetal growth and wellbeing, and identification and management of obstetric complications. Promotion of health and wellbeing via education and support for nutrition, cessation of substance abuse, uptake of family planning, recognition of danger signs and birth preparedness are included as essential components of {ANC}. Conclusions: New signal functions have been developed which can be used for monitoring and evaluation of content and quality of {ANC}.

Setting Primary health centres, {TB} dispensaries, and surrounding communities in four districts of Mongolia. Design Three retrospective cross-sectional cohort studies, and two longitudinal studies each individually nested in one of the cohort studies. Participants 15 947 community members from high {TB}-risk populations; 8518 patients screened for {TB} in primary health centres and referred to dispensaries; 857 patients with index {TB} and 2352 household contacts. Primary and secondary outcome measures 14 indicators of the quality of {TB} care defined by the Zero {TB} Indicator Framework and organised into three care cascades, evaluating community-based active case-finding, passive case-finding in health facilities and {TB} screening and prevention among close contacts; individual and health-system predictors of these indicators. Results The cumulative proportions of participants receiving guideline-adherent care varied widely, from 96\% for community-based active case-finding, to 79\% for {TB} preventive therapy among household contacts, to only 67\% for passive case-finding in primary health centres and {TB} dispensaries (range: 29\%-80\% across districts). The odds of patients completing active {TB} treatment decreased substantially with increasing age ({aOR}: 0.76 per decade, 95\% {CI}: 0.71 to 0.83, p{\textless}0.001) and among men ({aOR}: 0.56, 95\% {CI}: 0.36 to 0.88, p=0.013). Contacts of older index patients also had lower odds of initiating and completing of {TB} preventive therapy ({aOR}: 0.60 per decade, 95\% {CI}: 0.38 to 0.93, p=0.022). Conclusions The Zero {TB} Framework provided a feasible and adaptable approach for using routine surveillance data to evaluate the quality of {TB} care and identify associated individual and health system factors. Future research should evaluate strategies for collecting process indicators more efficiently; gather qualitative data on explanations for low-quality care; and deploy quality improvement interventions.  © 2022 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

	abstract = {Background {AU} Universal: Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly health coverage ({UHC}) encompasses 2 main components: : access to essential healthcare services and protection from financial hardship when using healthcare. This study examines Myanmar’s efforts to achieve {UHC} on a national and subnational level. It is a primer of studying the concept of {UHC} on a subnational level, and it also establishes a baseline for assessing future progress toward reaching {UHC} in Myanmar. Methods and findings The study uses the Demographic and Health Survey (2015) and the Myanmar Living Conditions Survey ({MLCS}; 2017) and adapts a previously developed {UHC} index to provide insights into the main barriers preventing the country’s progress toward {UHC}. We find a negative correlation between the {UHC} index and the state/region poverty levels. The equity of access analysis reveals significant pro-rich inequity in access to all essential healthcare services. Socioeconomic status and limited availability of healthcare infrastructure are the main driving forces behind the unequal access to interventions that are crucial to achieving {UHC} by 2030. Finally, financial risk protection analysis shows that the poor are less likely to use healthcare services, and, once they do, they are at a greater risk of suffering financial catastrophe. Limitations of this study revolve around its correlational, rather than causal, nature. Conclusions We suggest a 2-pronged approach to help Myanmar achieve {UHC}: Government and state authorities should reduce the financial burden of seeking healthcare, and, coupled with this, significant investment in and expansion of health infrastructure and the health workforce should be made, particularly in the poorer and more remote states. © 2021 Nikoloski et al.

	abstract = {Background: Unsafe abortion is one of the major public health problems in Thailand. Although the penal code of Thailand and the Thai Medical Council permit doctors to perform safe abortion in certain conditions, little is known about the attitudes that new medical doctors have towards abortion. The objectives of this article are to explore the attitudes towards abortion in certain conditions among new medical graduates and to identify factors related to those attitudes. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2018 among 2017 medical graduates who attended the annual workplace selection forum. The participants came from the two main tracks of admission to Thai medical schools: normal track and special track physicians, namely, the Collaborative Project to Increase Production of Rural Doctors ({CPIRD}). Of these 2017 graduates, 926 returned the questionnaire with complete information. Descriptive analysis, factor analysis, and multi-variable regression analysis were performed. Results: We found that most physicians agreed to perform abortions in the context of life-threatening conditions for mothers and children, but not under conditions directly related to physical health (such as pregnancy with socioeconomic problems or pregnancy in adolescents). {CPIRD} doctors were less amenable than normal track doctors in providing abortions if the reason for the termination of pregnancy was related to socioeconomic problems. Conclusion: The study suggests that a proactive campaign for new medical graduates to raise awareness and mutual understanding of abortion services should be exercised. The {CPIRD} curricula relating to safe abortion should enhance the capacity of medical graduates to deal with pregnant women who face not only a physical health-related problem, but also socioeconomic difficulties and well-being as a whole. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction Information on laboratory test availability and current testing scope among general hospitals in Kenya is not readily available. We sought to explore the reporting trends and test availability within clinical laboratories in Kenya over a 24-months period through analysis of the laboratory data reported in the District Health Information System ({DHIS}2). Methods Monthly hospital laboratory testing data were extracted from the Kenyan {DHIS}2 between January 2018 and December 2019. We used the national laboratory testing summary tool ({MoH} 706) to identify the tests of interest among 204 general hospitals in Kenya. A local practitioner panel consisting of individuals with laboratory expertise was used to classify the tests as common and uncommon. We compared the tests on the {MoH} 706 template with the Essential Diagnostic List ({EDL}) of the World Health Organisation and further reclassified them into test categories based on the {EDL} for generalisability of our findings. Evaluation of the number of monthly test types reported in each facility and the largest number of tests ever reported in any of the 24 months were used to assess test availability and testing scope, respectively. Results Out of the 204 general hospitals assessed, 179 (179/204) reported at least one of the 80 tests of interest in any of the 24 months. Only 41\% (74/179) of the reporting hospitals submitted all their monthly {DHIS}2 laboratory reports for the entire 24 months. The median testing capacity across the hospitals was 40\% with a wide variation in testing scope from one hospital laboratory to another (\% {IQR}: 33.8-51.9). Testing scope was inconsistent within facilities as indicated by often large monthly fluctuations in the total number of recommended and {EDL} tests reported. Tests of anatomical pathology and cancer were the least reported with 4 counties' hospitals not reporting any cancer or anatomical pathology tests for the entire 24 months. Conclusion The current reporting of laboratory testing information in {DHIS}2 is poor. Monitoring access and utilisation of laboratory testing across the country would require significant improvements in consistency and coverage of routine laboratory test reporting in {DHIS}2. Nonetheless, the available data suggest unequal and intermittent population access to laboratory testing provided by general hospitals in Kenya.  © 2022 Bahati et al.

	abstract = {Introduction The {COVID}-19 pandemic has adversely affected health systems in many countries, but little is known about effects on health systems in sub-Saharan Africa. This study examines the effects of {COVID}-19 on hospital utilisation in a sub-Saharan country, Sierra Leone. Methods Mixed-methods study using longitudinal nationwide hospital data (admissions, operations, deliveries and referrals) and qualitative interviews with healthcare workers and patients. Hospital data were compared across quarters (Q) in 2020, with day 1 of Q2 representing the start of the pandemic in Sierra Leone. Admissions are reported in total and disaggregated by sex, service (surgical, medical, maternity and paediatric) and hospital type (government or private non-profit). Referrals in 2020 were compared with 2019 to assess whether any changes were the result of seasonality. Comparisons were performed using Student's t-test. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results From Q1 to Q2, weekly mean hospital admissions decreased by 14.7\% (p=0.005). Larger decreases were seen in male 18.8\% than female 12.5\% admissions. The largest decreases were in surgical admissions, a 49.8\% decrease (p{\textless}0.001) and medical admissions, a 28.7\% decrease (p=0.002). Paediatric and maternity admissions did not significantly change. Total operations decreased by 13.9\% (p{\textless}0.001), while caesarean sections and facility-based deliveries showed significant increases: 12.7\% (p=0.014) and 7.5\% (p=0.03), respectively. In Q3, total admissions remained 13.2\% lower (p{\textless}0.001) than Q1. Mean weekly referrals were lower in Q2 and Q3 of 2020 compared with 2019, suggesting findings were unlikely to be seasonal. Qualitative analysis identified both supply-side factors, prioritisation of essential services, introduction of {COVID}-19 services and pausing elective care, and demand-side factors, fear of nosocomial infection and financial hardship. Conclusion The study demonstrated a decrease in hospital utilisation during {COVID}-19, the decrease is less than reported in other countries during {COVID}-19 and less than reported during the Ebola epidemic.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

	abstract = {Background: Older people coming from a lower wealth gradient are more vulnerable to have stressful life events further adding more risk for common mental health disorders and psychological distress situations. The present study explores the associations between socioeconomic and health-related variables and psychological distress among older adults in India and the contribution of such factors to the inequalities in psychological distress. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 9181 older adults conducted as ‘Building a Knowledge Base on Population Ageing in India’ was assessed. Logistic regression and decomposition models were used to analyze the data. Psychological distress was measured from General Health Questionnaire ({GHQ}-12). The value of Cronbach's alpha was 0.90. It was having a scale of 0 to 12 on the basis of experiencing stressful symptoms and was re-coded as 0 (representing 6+ stressful symptoms) and 1 (representing 5 and fewer symptoms). Results: Older adults from the poored, suffering from multi-morbidity, disabled, with low activities of daily living and low instrumental activities of daily living and poor cognitive ability were suffering from high psychological distress in India. Further, factors such as religion, caste, education, living arrangements, and self-worth in the family were major contributors to the concentration of psychological distress in older adults from poor households (concentration index: − 0.23). Conclusion: The study suggests that among older people, there is a wide disparity of experiencing psychological distress across different socio-economic groups with significant factors being responsible for inequality in psychological distress. There is a need to build a “win-win” circumstance across sectors, including a broad spectrum of health, social and economic benefits to the vulnerable older population. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Health management information systems ({HMIS}) are a crucial source of timely health statistics and have the potential to improve reporting in low-income countries. However, concerns about data quality have hampered their widespread adoption in research and policy decisions. This article presents results from a data verification study undertaken to gain insights into the quality of {HMIS} data in Ethiopia. We also provide recommendations for working with {HMIS} data for research and policy translation. We linked the {HMIS} to the 2016 Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care Assessment, a national census of all health facilities that provided maternal and newborn health services in Ethiopia. We compared the number of visits for deliveries and caesarean sections (C-sections) reported in the {HMIS} in 2015 (January–December) to those found in source documents (paper-based labour and delivery and operating theatre registers) in 2425 facilities across Ethiopia. We found that two-thirds of facilities had ‘good’ {HMIS} reporting for deliveries (defined as reporting within 10\% of source documents) and half had ‘very good’ reporting (within 5\% of source documents). Results were similar for reporting on C-section deliveries. We found that good reporting was more common in urban areas ({OR}: 1.30, 95\% {CI} 1.06 to 1.59), public facilities ({OR}: 2.95, 95\% {CI} 1.38 to 6.29) and in hospitals compared with health centres ({OR}: 1.71, 95\% {CI} 1.13 to 2.61). Facilities in the Somali and Afar regions had the lowest odds of good reporting compared with Addis Ababa and were more likely to over-report deliveries in the {HMIS}. Further work remains to address remaining discrepancies in the Ethiopian {HMIS}. Nonetheless, our findings corroborate previous data verification exercises in Ethiopia and support greater use and uptake of {HMIS} data for research and policy decisions (particularly, greater use of {HMIS} data elements (eg, absolute number of services provided each month) rather than coverage indicators). Increased use of these data, combined with feedback mechanisms, is necessary to maintain data quality. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under {CC} {BY}. Published by {BMJ}.},

	abstract = {Background: Caesarean section (C-section) delivery is an important indicator of access to life-saving essential obstetric care. Yet, there is limited understanding of the costs of utilising C-section delivery care in sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, we estimated the direct and indirect patient cost of accessing C-section in Tanzania. Methods: Cross-sectional survey data of 2012 was used, which covered 3000 households from 11 districts in three regions. We interviewed women who had given births in the last 12 months before the survey to capture their experience of care. We used a regression model to estimate the effect of C-section on costs, while the degree of inequality on C-section coverage was assessed with a concentration index. Results: C-section increased the likelihood of paying for health care by 16\% compared to normal delivery. The additional cost of C-section compared to normal delivery was 20 {USD}, but reduced to about 11 {USD} when restricted to public facilities. Women with C-section delivery spent an extra 2 days at the health facility compared to normal delivery, but this was reduced slightly to 1.9 days in public facilities. The distribution of C-section coverage was significantly in favour of wealthier than poorest women ({CI} = 0.2052, p {\textless} 0.01), and this pro-rich pattern was consistent in rural districts but with unclear pattern in urban districts. Conclusions: C-section is a life-saving intervention but is associated with significant economic burden especially among the poor families. More health resources are needed for provision of free maternal care, reduce inequality in access and improve birth outcomes in Tanzania. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Proportions of facility births are increasing throughout sub-Saharan Africa, but obstetric services vary within the health system. In Tanzania, advanced management of childbirth complications (comprehensive emergency obstetric care) is offered in hospitals, while in frontline, primary health care ({PHC}) facilities (health centres and dispensaries) mostly only routine childbirth care is available. With over half (54\%) of rural births in facilities, we hypothesized the presence of socio-economic inequity in hospital-based childbirth uptake in rural Tanzania and explored whether this relationship was modified by parity. This inequity may compound the burden of greater mortality among the poorest women and their babies. Records for 4456 rural women from the 2015-16 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey with a live birth in the preceding 5 years were examined. Proportions of births at each location (home/{PHC}/hospital) were calculated by demographic and obstetric characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression was used to obtain crude and adjusted odds ratios of home/{PHC} and hospital/{PHC} births based on household wealth, including interaction between wealth and parity. Post-estimation margins analysis was applied to estimate childbirth location by wealth and parity. Hospital-based childbirth uptake was inequitable. The gap between poorest and richest was less pronounced at first birth. Hospital-based care utilization was lowest (around 10\%) among the poorest multiparous women, with no increase at high parity (≥5) despite higher risk. {PHC}-based childbirth care was used by a consistent proportion of women after the first birth (range 30-51\%). The poorest women utilized it at intermediate parity, but at parity ≥5 mostly gave birth at home. In an effort to provide effective childbirth care to all women, context-specific strategies are required to improve hospital-based care use, and poor, rural, high parity women are a particularly vulnerable group that requires specific attention. Improving childbirth care in {PHC} and strengthening referral linkages would benefit a considerable proportion of women. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {Background: High fertility rates and unintended pregnancies are public health concerns of lower and middle income countries such as Ethiopia. Long acting contraceptives ({LACs}) take the lion’s share in reducing unintended pregnancies and high fertility rates. Despite their numerous advantages, the utilization of {LACs} remains low in Ethiopia. This study is aimed to explore the geographic variation and associated factors of long acting contraceptive use among reproductive-age women in Ethiopia. Methods: This is a secondary data analysis of 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey ({EDHS}) data. A total of weighted sample sizes of 10,439 reproductive-age women were included in the final analysis. To clean and analyze the none-spatial data Stata 14 was used while {ArcGIS} 10.6 and {SaTScanTM} version 9.6 software were used for spatial analysis. Multilevel Mixed-effect Logistic regression model was used to identify associated factors of {LACs} utilization. An Adjusted Odds Ratio ({AOR}) with 95\% Confidence Interval ({CI}) was reported to identify significant variables. Results: Long acting contraceptive utilization was non-random (Moran’s I: 0.30, p-value {\textless} 0.01). Statistically, clusters with significant low utilization of {LACs} were found in Somali, Afar, Gambela, northern Amhara, eastern Oromia and western part of Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples ({SNNP}) regions. Adjusting for other factors such as being married ({AOR} = 2.51, 95\% {CI}: 1.29–4.87), having one to two ({AOR} = 2.14, 95\% {CI}: 1.43–3.22), and three to four children ({AOR} = 1.68, 95\% {CI}: 1.02–2.76), urban ({AOR} = 1.59, 95\% {CI}: 1.16–2.19), want no more children ({AOR} = 1.40, 95\% {CI}: 1.08–1.83), working status of women ({AOR} = 1.33, 95\% {CI}: 1.07–1.65) increased the odds of {LACs} utilization. While previous history of abortion ({AOR} = 0.56, 95\% {CI}: 0.39–0.80), and living in the pastoralist community ({AOR} = 0.22, 95\% {CI}: 0.14–0.35) reduced the odds of {LACs} utilization in Ethiopia Conclusions: Significant geographic variation of {LACs} utilization was observed in Ethiopia. Spots with Low {LACs} utilization were found in the eastern, north eastern and western part of the country. Socio-demographic and pregnancy related factors were significant determinants of {LACs} utilization. Designing intervention programs targeting the identified hot spot clusters, and variables that can hinder the utilization of {LACs} is very important to increase the utilization. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Although there have been notable improvements in availability and utilization of maternal health care in Afghanistan over the last few decades, risk of maternal mortality remains very high. Previous studies have highlighted gaps in quality of emergency obstetric and newborn care practices, however, little is known about the quality of routine intrapartum care at health facilities in Afghanistan. Methods: We analyzed a subset of data from the 2016 Afghanistan Maternal and Newborn Health Quality of Care Assessment that comprised of observations of labor, delivery and immediate post-partum care, as well as health facility assessments and provider interviews across all accessible public health facilities with an average of five or more births per day in the preceding year (N = 77). Using the Quality of the Process of Intrapartum and Immediate Postpartum Care index, we calculated a quality of care score for each observation. We conducted descriptive and bivariate analyses and built a multivariate linear regression model to identify facility-level factors associated with quality of care scores. Results: Across 665 childbirth observations, low quality of care was observed such that no health facility type received an average quality score over 56\%. The multivariate regression model indicated that availability of routine labor and delivery supplies, training in respectful maternity care, perceived gender equality for training opportunities, recent supervision, and observation during supervision have positive, statistically significant associations with quality of care. Conclusions: Quality of routine intrapartum care at health facilities in Afghanistan is concerningly low. Our analysis suggests that multi-faceted interventions are needed to address direct and indirect contributors to quality of care including clinical care practices, attention to client experiences during labor and childbirth, and attention to staff welfare and opportunities, including gender equality within the health workforce. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Design and methods This explanatory qualitative study consisted of in-depth interviews about factors influencing surgical productivity in Sierra Leone. Interviews were analysed with a thematic network analysis and used to develop a conceptual framework. Participants and setting 21 surgical providers and hospital managers working in 12 public and private non-profit hospitals in all regions in Sierra Leone. Results Surgical providers in Sierra Leone experience a broad range of factors within and outside the health system that influence their productivity. The main barriers involve both patient and facility financial constraints, lack of equipment and supplies, weak regulation of providers and facilities and a small surgical workforce, which experiences a lack of recognition. Initiation of a Free Health Care Initiative for obstetric and paediatric care, collaborations with partners or non-governmental organisations, and increased training opportunities for highly motivated surgical providers are identified as opportunities to increase productivity. Discussion Broader nationwide health system strengthening is required to facilitate an increase in surgical productivity and meet surgical needs in Sierra Leone. Development of a national strategy for surgery, obstetrics and anaesthesia, including methods to reduce financial barriers for patients, improve supply-mechanisms and expand training opportunities for new and established surgical providers can increase surgical capacity. Establishment of legal frameworks and appropriate remuneration are crucial for sustainability and retention of surgical health workers.  ©},

	abstract = {Background Effective coverage measures aim to estimate the proportion of a population in need of a service that received a positive health outcome. In 2020, the Effective Coverage Think Tank Group recommended using a ‘coverage cascade' for maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health and nutrition ({MNCAHN}), which organises components of effective coverage in a stepwise fashion, with each step accounting for different aspects of quality of care ({QoC}), applied at the population level. The cascade outlines six steps that increase the likelihood that the population in need experience the intended health benefit: 1) the population in need (target population) who contact a health service; 2) that has the inputs available to deliver the service; 3) who receive the health service; 4) according to quality standards; 5) and adhere to prescribed medication(s) or health workers instructions; and 6) experience the expected health outcome. We examined how effective coverage of life-saving interventions from childbirth to children aged nine has been defined and assessed which steps of the cascade are captured by existing measures. Methods We undertook a rapid systematic review. Seven scientific literature databases were searched covering the period from May 1, 2017 to July, 8 2021. Reference lists from reviews published in 2018 and 2019 were examined to identify studies published prior to May 2017. Eligible studies reported population-level contact coverage measures adjusted for at least one dimension of {QoC}. Results Based on these two search approaches this review includes literature published from 2010 to 2021. From 16 662 records reviewed, 33 studies were included, reporting 64 effective coverage measures. The most frequently examined measures were for childbirth and immediate newborn care (n = 24). No studies examined measures among children aged five to nine years. Definitions of effective coverage varied across studies. Key sources of variability included (i) whether a single effective coverage measure was reported for a package of interventions or separate measures were calculated for each intervention; (ii) the number and type of coverage cascade steps applied to adjust for {QoC}; and (iii) the individual items included in the effective coverage definition and the methods used to generate a composite quality measure. Conclusion In the {MNCAHN} literature there is substantial heterogeneity in both definitions and construction of effective coverage, limiting the comparability of measures over time and place. Current measurement approaches are not closely aligned with the proposed cascade. For widespread adoption, there is a need for greater standardisation of indicator definitions and transparency in reporting, so governments can use these measures to improve investments in {MNACHN} and implement life-saving health policies and programs. © 2022.

Design A retrospective secondary analysis using the three most recent (2005, 2010 and 2014) Demographic and Health Surveys. Setting Cambodia. Participants 53 155 women aged 15-49 years old and 23 242 children under 5 years old across the three surveys. Outcome measures We estimated crude coverage, effective coverage and inequality in effective coverage for five {MCH} services over time: antenatal care ({ANC}), facility delivery and sick childcare for diarrhoea, pneumonia and fever. Quality was defined by the proportion of care seekers who received a set of interventions during healthcare visits. Effective coverage was estimated by combining crude coverage and quality. We used equiplots and risk ratios, to assess patterns in inequality in {MCH} effective coverage across wealth quintile, urban-rural and women's education levels and over time. Results In 2014, crude and effective coverage was 80.1\% and 56.4\%, respectively, for maternal health services ({ANC} and facility delivery) and 59.1\% and 26.9\%, respectively, for sick childcare (diarrhoea, pneumonia and fever). Between 2005 and 2014, effective coverage improved for all services, but improvements were larger for maternal healthcare than for sick child care. In 2014, poorer children were more likely to receive oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea than children from richer households. Meanwhile, women from urban areas were more likely to receive a postnatal check before getting discharged. Conclusions Effective coverage has generally improved in Cambodia but efforts remain to improve quality for all {MCH} services. Our results point to substantial gaps in curative sick child care, a large share of which is provided by unregulated private providers in Cambodia. Policymakers should focus on improving effective coverage, and not only crude coverage, to achieve the health-related Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. © 2022 {BMJ} Publishing Group.

	abstract = {Background Ethiopia aims to eliminate lymphatic filariasis by 2020, through a dual approach of mass drug administration to interrupt transmission and morbidity control which includes making hydrocele surgery available in all endemic areas. Locating patients requiring surgery, providing high quality surgeries, and following up patients are all formidable challenges for many resource-challenged or difficult-to-reach communities. To date, hydrocele surgery in Ethiopia has only occurred when a patient has the knowledge, time and resources to travel to regional hospitals. Ethiopia tested the novel approach of using a surgical camp, defined as mobilizing, transporting, providing surgery at a static site, and following up of a large cohort of hydrocele patients within a hospital’s catchment area, to address delays in seeking and receiving care. Methodology and results Health extension workers mobilized 252 patients with scrotal swelling from a list of 385 suspected hydrocele cases from seven endemic districts in the region of Beneshangul-Gumuz. Clinical health workers and surgeons confirmed 119 as eligible for surgery. Of 70 additional patients who self-referred, 56 were eligible for surgery. Over a two-week period at a regional hospital, 175 hydrocele excision surgeries were conducted. After discharge three days after surgery, trained clinical health workers followed up with the patients on Day 5, Day 8, Day 14 and 1st-month benchmarks with a randomized follow-up of a selection of patients conducted at 9–12 months. There were no post-operative complications upon discharge at Day 3 and 22, while minor complications occurred (12.6\%) between Day 3 and one month. The 9–12 month follow-up found patients self-reported an improvement in quality of life, health and economic status. Conclusion A hydrocele surgery camp was effective at providing a large number of quality surgeries in a short time. Using peripheral health workers to mobilize and follow up patients helped address delays in seeking and receiving quality care. Mainstreaming patient mobilization and follow-up into a community health system could be effective in other countries. The camp’s results also influenced two regions in Ethiopia to change their policies in order to offer free hydrocele surgery (including patient transport, consultation, surgery, diagnostic tests and necessary medications). © 2021, Public Library of Science.

We present a standardised protocol with the aim to fill a gap in understanding the needs, attitudes and practices related to sexual and reproductive health in the context of {COVID}-19 pandemic, focusing on pregnancy, pregnancy prevention and abortion. Methods and analysis plan This protocol is a prospective qualitative research, using semi-structured interviews with at least 15 pregnant women at different gestational ages and after delivery, 6 months apart from the first interview. At least 10 partners, 10 non-pregnant women and 5 healthcare professionals will be interviewed once during the course of the research. Higher number of subjects may be needed if a saturation is not achieved with these numbers. Data collection will be performed in a standardised way by skilled trained interviewers using written notes or audio-record of the interview. The data will be explored using the thematic content analysis and the researchers will look for broad patterns, generalisations or theories from these categories.

	abstract = {Background: Uptake of services to treat newborns and children has been persistently low in Ethiopia, despite being provided free-of-charge by Health Extension Workers ({HEWs}). In order to increase the uptake of these services, the Optimizing the Health Extension Project was designed to be implemented in four regions in Ethiopia. This study was carried out to identify barriers to the uptake of these services and potential solutions to inform the project. Methods: Qualitative data were collected in October and November 2015 in 15 purposely selected districts in four regions. We conducted 90 focus group discussions and 60 in-depth interviews reaching a total of 664 participants. Thematic analysis was used to identify key barriers and potential solutions. Results: Five demand-side barriers to utilization of health services were identified. Misconceptions about illness causation, compounded with preference for traditional healers has affected service uptake. Limited awareness of the availability of free curative services for children at health posts; along with the prevailing perception that {HEWs} were providing preventive services only had constrained uptake. Geographic challenge that made access to the health post difficult was the other barrier. Four supply-side barriers were identified. Health post closure and drug stock-out led to inconsistent availability of services. Limited confidence and skill among {HEWs} and under-resourced physical facilities affected the service delivery. Study participants suggested demand creation solutions such as increasing community awareness on curative service availability and educating them on childhood illness causation. Maintaining consistent supplies and ensuring service availability; along with regular support to build {HEWs}’ confidence were the suggested supply-side solutions. Creating community feedback mechanisms was suggested as a way of addressing community concerns on the health services. Conclusion: This study explored nine demand- and supply-side barriers that decreased the uptake of community-based services. It indicated the importance of increasing awareness of new services and addressing prevailing barriers that deprioritize health services. At the same time, supply-side barriers would have to be tackled by strengthening the health system to uphold newly introduced services and harness sustainable impact. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The importance of developing an effective action-based model of care for multimorbid patients has become common knowledge, but it remains unclear why researchers in Nigeria have not paid attention to the issue. Hence, this study assessed the quality of health services using the Donabedian model and aimed to recommend an effective hospital care delivery model for older people in Nigeria with multimorbidity. A cross-sectional study using face-to-face data was conducted between October 2021 and February 2022. The reported data were collated, checked, coded, and entered into {JISC} online survey software and then exported to {IBM} Statistical Package for Social Science ({SPSS}) version 27 for analysis, sourced from the University of West London, London, United Kingdom. The data were collected from the outpatient department of four high-volume public secondary hospitals in Niger State (the largest hospital in the three senatorial zones and that of the state capital). Systematic random sampling was used to select 734 patients with two or more chronic diseases (multimorbidity) aged 60 years and above who presented for routine ambulatory outpatient and consented to participate in the study. A Service Availability and Readiness Assessment ({SARA}) tool was used to assess the structure, and the process quality was assessed by the patients’ experiences as they navigated the care pathway, whereas the outcome was measured using the patients’ overall satisfaction. Using Spearman’s correlation, no statistically significant association was observed between satisfaction level with the healthcare that was received and the five domains of health facility readiness (Total score Basic Amenities, Total score Basic Equipment, Total score infection control, Total score diagnostic capacity, Total score essential drugs), and the general facility readiness. Finally, the process component superseded the structure as the determinant of the quality of healthcare among multimorbid patients in Niger State. The emphasis of the process should be on improving access to quality of care, improving patient–physician relationships and timing, reducing the financial burden of medical care, and building confidence and trust in medical care. Therefore, these factors should be incorporated into designing the healthcare model for multimorbid patients in Nigeria. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee {MDPI}, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Skilled birth attendance is critical to reduce infant and maternal mortality. Health development plans and strategies, especially in developing countries, consider equity in access to maternal health care services as a priority. This study aimed to measure and analyze the inequality in the use of skilled birth attendance services in Mauritania. The study identifies the inequality determinants and explores its changes over the period 2007–2015. The concentration curve, concentration index, decomposition of the concentration index, and Oaxaca-type decomposition technique were performed to measure socioeconomically-based inequalities in skilled birth attendance services utilization, and to identify the contribution of different determinants to such inequality as well as the changes in inequality overtime using data from Mauritania Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys ({MICS}) 2007 and 2015. The concentration index for skilled birth attendance services use dropped from 0.6324 (p {\textless} 0.001) in 2007 to 0.5852 (p {\textless} 0.001) in 2015. Prenatal care, household wealth level, and rural−urban residence contributed most to socioeconomic inequality. The concentration index decomposition and the Oaxaca-type decomposition revealed that changes in prenatal care and rural−urban residence contributed positively to lower inequality, but household economic status had an opposite contribution. Clearly, the pro-rich inequality in skilled birth attendance is high in Mauritania, despite a slight decrease during the study period. Policy actions on eliminating geo-graphical and socioeconomic inequalities should target increased access to skilled birth attendance. Multisectoral policy action is needed to improve social determinants of health and to remove health system bottlenecks. This will include the socioeconomic empowerment of women and girls, while enhancing the availability and affordability of reproductive and maternal health commodities. This policy action can be achieved through improving the availability of obstetric service providers in rural areas; ensuring better distribution and quality of health infrastructure, particularly health posts and health centers; and, ensuring user fees removal for equitable, efficient, and sustainable financial protection in line with the universal health coverage objectives. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Inequality in access and utilization of health services because of socioeconomic status is unfair, and it should be monitored and corrected with appropriate remedial action. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the distribution of benefits from public spending on health care across socioeconomic groups in Ethiopia using a benefit incidence analysis. We employed health service utilization data from the Living Standard Measurement Survey, recurrent government expenditure data from the Ministry of Finance and health services delivery data from the Ministry of Health's Health Management Information System. We calculated unit subsidy as the ratio of recurrent government health expenditure on a particular service type to the corresponding number of health services visits. The concentration index ({CI}) was applied to measure inequality in health care utilization and the distribution of the subsidy across socioeconomic groups. We conducted a disaggregated analysis comparing health delivery levels and service types. Furthermore, we used decomposition analysis to measure the percentage contribution of various factors to the overall inequalities. We found that 61\% of recurrent government spending on health goes to health centres ({HCs}), and 74\% was spent on outpatient services. Besides, we found a slightly pro-poor public spending on health, with a {CI} of -0.039, yet the picture was more nuanced when disaggregated by health delivery levels and service types. The subsidy at the hospital level and for inpatient services benefited the wealthier quintiles most. However, at the {HC} level and for outpatient services, the subsidies were slightly pro-poor. Therefore, an effort is needed in making inpatient and hospital services more equitable by improving the health service utilization of those in the lower quintiles and those in rural areas. Besides, policymakers in Ethiopia should use this evidence to monitor inequity in government spending on health, thereby improving government resources allocation to target the disadvantaged better.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {Background: Routine maternity care visits ({MCVs}) such as antenatal care ({ANC}), institutional delivery, and postnatal care ({PNC}) visits are crucial to utilisation of maternal and newborn health ({MNH}) interventions during pregnancy-postnatal period. In Nepal, however, not all women complete these routine {MCVs}. Therefore, this study examined the levels and correlates of (dis)continuity of {MCVs} across the antenatal-postnatal period. Methods: We conducted further analysis of the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey. A total of 1,978 women aged 15–49 years, who had live birth two years preceding the survey, were included in the analysis. The outcome variable was (dis)continuity of routine {MCVs} (at least four {ANC} visits, institutional delivery, and {PNC} visit) across the pathway of antennal through to postnatal period. Independent variables included several social determinants of health under structural, intermediary, and health system domains. Multinomial logistic regression was conducted to identify the correlates of routine {MCVs}. Relative risk ratios ({RR}) were reported with 95\% confidence intervals at a significance level of p{\textless}0.05. Results: Approximately 41\% of women completed all routine {MCVs} with a high proportion of discontinuation around childbirth. Women of disadvantaged ethnicities, from low wealth status, who were illiterate had higher {RR} of discontinuation of {MCVs} (compared to completion of all {MCVs}). Similarly, women who speak Bhojpuri, from remote provinces (Karnali and Sudurpaschim), who had a high birth order (≥4), who were involved in the agricultural sector, and who had unwanted last birth had a higher {RR} of discontinuation of {MCVs}. Women discontinued routine {MCVs} if they had poor awareness of health mother-groups and perceived the problem of not having female providers. Conclusions: Routine monitoring using composite coverage indicators is required to track the levels of (dis)continuity of routine {MCVs} at the maternity care continuum. Strategies such as raising awareness on the importance of maternity care, care provision from female health workers could potentially improve the completion of {MCVs}. In addition, policy and programmes for continuity of maternity care are needed to focus on women with socioeconomic and ethnic disadvantages and from remote provinces. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Concern is justified observing the link between the {AIDS} and {COVID}-19 pandemics. {COVID}-19 outcomes are significantly worse in many people living with {HIV} ({PLHIV}), even when vaccinated, because of their impaired immune system. Moreover, {CD}4 T-cells are affected by both {HIV} and {SARS}-{CoV}-2.1-3 {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants can evolve in immunosuppressed patients due to prolonged viral replication in the context of an inadequate immune response.4 Accelerated intrahost evolution of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 was reported in a South African {HIV} patient with antiretroviral therapy ({ART}) failure.5 6 With 25 million {HIV} patients in sub-Saharan Africa ({SSA}) of whom an estimated 8 million are not virologically suppressed, this potentially creates a reservoir for future variants. Such variants, arising in {PLHIV} anywhere in the world, can spread to other continents, as has been reported for variants of concern ({VoCs}) (Beta, Omicron) and variants of interest (B.1.6.20, B.1.640.2) that arose in Africa.7-9 Conversely, the {COVID}-19 pandemic impacts {HIV} treatment programmes, due to supply chain issues, overburdening of healthcare systems, limiting access to testing, treatment and prevention programmes and further increasing inequalities.10 Modelled {COVID}-19 disruptions of {HIV} programmes in {SSA} included decreased functionality of {HIV} prevention programmes, {HIV} testing and treatment, healthcare services such as viral load testing, adherence counselling, drug regimen switches and {ART} interruptions, which may lead to selection of drug-resistant {HIV}.11 A 6-month interruption affecting 50\% of the population would lead to a median number of excess deaths of 296 000, during 1 year. Scientists advocate for the {AIDS} and {COVID}-19 pandemics in Africa to be addressed simultaneously, by increasing African access to {COVID}-19 vaccines, prioritising research on the interaction between {HIV} care and {COVID}-19, maintaining high-quality {HIV} services and integrating health services for both viruses.7 Both the {COVID}-19 and the {AIDS} pandemic, more specifically the issue of {HIV} drug resistance ({HIVDR}), have previously been described as wicked problems which are best studied as complex adaptive systems ({CASs}).12-15Wicked problems consist of diverse interconnected factors and require complexity-informed and locally adapted solutions rather than one solution that fits all. We recently designed a qualitative model of all known factors influencing {HIVDR} in {SSA} and analysed its complexity.13 Our detailed systems map featured three main feedback loops driving {HIVDR}, representing (1) the alternation between adherence and non-adherence, (2) the impact of an overburdened healthcare system and (3) the importance of sustaining global efforts of tackling {HIVDR} even when new antiretroviral drugs with high genetic barriers become available. These {HIV}-related feedback loops are interconnected with {COVID}-19 pandemic impact (in yellow, figure 1). The loop starts from {PLHIV} with an unsuppressed viral load, which weakens the immune system and may in turn slow down immune clearance of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, allowing prolonged replication and mutation of the virus in the context of an inadequate immune response. Prolonged viral clearance facilitates the selection of immune escape {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants. Variants may emerge that have a selective advantage and therefore may spread through populations due to increased transmissibility (with possibly increased virulence), thereby creating an additional burden on the healthcare system, putting the overall healthcare system and the {HIV} care at risk. These stressors on the healthcare system lead to a higher risk of unsuppressed viral load in {PLHIV}, increasing the risk of {HIVDR}. Figure 1 shows the need to address both wicked problems simultaneously and to do so in a complexity-informed manner as they are inevitably linked and influence each other. Evidently, the exact interconnections between both pandemics need to be locally assessed. For instance, a study in South Africa showed that while lockdown severely impacted {HIV} testing and {ART} initiation, {ART} provision was largely maintained, indicating that the strength of the connection between the virological suppression-related loop and the pandemic, indicated in figure 1, are context-dependent.16  ©},

	abstract = {Background: Clinical trials are increasingly perceived as a therapeutic opportunity for cancer patients. Favoring their concentration in few high-expertise academic centers maximizes quality of data collection but poses an issue of access equality. Analytical tools to quantify trial accessibility are needed to rationalize resources. Materials and methods: We constructed a distance-based accessibility index ({dAI}) using publicly available data on demographics, cancer incidence and trials. Multiple strategies were applied to mitigate or quantify clear sources of bias: reporting biases by text mining multiple registries; reliability of simple geographical distance by comparison with high-quality travel cost data for Italy; index inflation due to highly heterogeneous cancer incidence by log-transformation. We studied inequalities by Gini index and time trend significance by Mann–Kendall test. We simulated different resource allocation models in representative countries and identified locations where new studies would maximally improve the national index. Results: The {dAI} approximated well a more realistic but not widely applicable travel cost-based index. Accessibility was unevenly distributed across and within countries (Gini index ∼0.75), with maximal inequalities in high- and upper-middle-income countries (China, United States, Russian Federation). Over time, accessibility increased but less than the total number of trials, most evidently in upper-middle-income countries. Simulations in representative countries (Italy and Serbia) identified ideal locations able to maximally raise the national index. Conclusions: Access to clinical trials is highly uneven across and within countries and is not mitigated by simple increase in the number of trials; a rational algorithmic approach can be used to mitigate inequalities. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background Lassa fever ({LF}) often presents clinically as undifferentiated febrile illness. Lassa Fever cases in Sierra Leone have been falling since the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic. Data from other {LF} endemic countries suggest that this is not a true reflection of local epidemiological decline, but rather a function of either health seeking behaviour or the health/referral system. In Sierra Leone, many other diseases present with a similar early clinical picture, including {COVID}-19 and Marburg Disease (which has recently emerged in neighbouring Guinea). This empirical study explores the implementation of health system processes associated with International Health Regulations ({IHR}) requirements for early detection and timely and effective responses to the spread of febrile disease, through the case study of {LF} in Sierra Leone. Methodology/Principal findings This study used a qualitative approach to analyse local policy and guidance documents, key informant interviews with policy and practice actors, and focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with health care workers ({HCWs}) and community health workers ({CHWs}) in Kenema District to examine the ways in which undifferentiated fever surveillance and response policies and processes were implemented in the post-Ebola period. Multiple challenges were identified, including: issues with the {LF} case definition, approaches to differential diagnosis, specimen transport and the provision of results, and ownership of laboratory data. These issues lead to delays in diagnosis, and potentially worse outcomes for individual patients, as well as affecting the system’s ability to respond to outbreak-prone disease. Conclusions/Significance Identification of ways to improve the system requires balancing vertical disease surveillance programmes against other population health needs. Therefore, health system challenges to early identification of {LF} specifically have implications for the effectiveness of the wider Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response ({IDSR}) system in Sierra Leone more generally. Sentinel surveillance or improved surveillance at maternity facilities would help improve viral haemorrhagic fever ({VHF}) surveillance, as well as knowledge of {LF} epidemiology. Strengthening surveillance for vertical disease programmes, if correctly targeted, could have downstream benefits for {COVID}-19 surveillance and response as well as the wider health system—and therefore patient outcomes more generally. © 2022 Hana Rohan.},

	abstract = {Area-based sampling approaches designed to capture pharmacies, drug shops, and other non-facility service delivery outlets are critical for accurately measuring the contraceptive service environment in contexts of increasing de-medicalization of contraceptive commodities and services. Evidence from other disciplines has demonstrated area-based estimates may be biased if there is spatial heterogeneity in product distribution, but this bias has not yet been assessed in the context of contraceptive supply estimates. The Consumer's Marker for Family Planning ({CM}4FP) study conducted censuses and product audits of contraceptive outlets across 12 study sites and 2-3 rounds of quarterly data collection in Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda. We assessed bias in estimates of contraceptive product availability by comparing estimates from simulations of area-based sampling approaches with census counts among all audited facilities for each study site and round of data collection. We found evidence of bias in estimates of contraceptive availability generated from simulated areabased sampling. Within specific study sites and rounds, we observed biased sampling estimates for several but not all contraceptive method types, with bias more likely to occur in sites with heterogeneity in both spatial distribution of outlets and product availability within outlets. In simulations varying size of enumeration areas ({EA}) and number of outlets sampled per {EA}, we demonstrated that the likelihood of substantial bias decreases as {EA} size decreases and as the number of outlets sampled per {EA} increases. Straightforward approaches such as increasing sample size per {EA} or applying statistical weights may be used to reduce area-based sampling bias, indicating a pragmatic way forward to improve estimates where design-based sampling is infeasible. Such approaches should be considered in development of improved methods for area-based estimates of contraceptive supply- side environments. © 2022 Keller et al.

	abstract = {Background: Child mortality from sickle cell disease in sub-Saharan Africa is presumed to be high but is not well quantified. This uncertainty contributes to the neglect of sickle cell disease and delays the prioritisation of interventions. In this study, we estimated the mortality of children in Nigeria with sickle cell disease, and the proportion of national under-5 mortality attributable to sickle cell disease. Methods: We did a model-estimated, population-level analysis of data from Nigeria's 2018 Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}) to estimate the prevalence and geographical distribution of {HbSS} and {HbSC} genotypes assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium near birth. Interviews for the survey were done between Aug 14 and Dec 29, 2018, and the embedded sickle cell disease survey was done in a randomly selected third of the overall survey's households. We developed an approach for estimating child mortality from sickle cell disease by combining information on tested children and their untested siblings. Tested children were aged 6–59 months at the time of the survey. Untested siblings born 0–14 years before the survey were also included in analyses. Testing as part of the {DHS} was done without regard to disease status. We analysed mortality differences using the inheritance-derived genotypic distribution of untested siblings older than the tested cohort, enabling us to estimate excess mortality from sickle cell disease for the older-sibling cohort (ie, those born between 2003 and 2013). Findings: We analysed test results for 11 186 children aged 6–59 months from 7411 households in Nigeria. The estimated average birth prevalence of {HbSS} was 1·21\% (95\% {CI} 1·09–1·37) and was 0·24\% (0·19–0·31) for {HbSC}. We obtained data for estimating child mortality from 10 195 tested children (who could be matched to the individual mother survey) and 17 205 of their untested siblings. 15 227 of the siblings were in the older-sibling cohort. The group of children with sickle cell disease born between 2003 and 2013 with at least one younger sibling in the survey had about 370 excess under-5 deaths per 1000 livebirths (95\% {CI} 150–580; p=0·0008) than children with {HbAA}. The estimated national average under-5 mortality for children with sickle cell disease born between 2003 and 2013 was 490 per 1000 livebirths (95\% {CI} 270–700), 4·0 times higher (95\% {CI} 2·1–6·0) than children with {HbAA}. About 4·2\% (95\% {CI} 1·7–6·9) of national under-5 mortality was attributable to excess mortality from sickle cell disease. Interpretation: The burden of child mortality from sickle cell disease in Nigeria continues to be disproportionately higher than the burden of mortality of children without sickle cell disease. Most of these deaths could be prevented if adequate resources were allocated and available focused interventions were implemented. The methods developed in this study could be used to estimate the burden of sickle cell disease elsewhere in Africa and south Asia.

	abstract = {Despite remarkable gains, improving neonatal survival globally remains slow paced. Innovative service-delivery packages have been developed for community health workers ({CHWs}) to maximize system efficiency and increase the reach of services. However, embedding these in health systems needs structural and procedural alignment. The Community-Based Newborn Care ({CBNC}) programme was a response to high neonatal mortality in Ethiopia. Key aspects include simplified treatment for neonatal illness, integrated outreach services and task-shifting. Using the {CHW} functionality model by {WHO}, this study evaluates the health system response to the programme, including quality of care. A before-and-after study was conducted with three survey time points: baseline (November 2013), midline (December 2015) and follow-up (December 2017 - 4 years after the programme started). Data were collected at a sample of primary healthcare facilities from 101 districts across four regions. Analysis took two perspectives: (1) health system response, through supplies, infrastructure support and supervision, assessed through interviews and observations at health facilities and (2) quality of care, through {CHWs}' theoretical capacity to deliver services, as well as their performance, assessed through functional health literacy and direct observation of young infant case management. Results showed gains in services for young infants, with antibiotics and job aids available at over 90\% of health centres. However, services at health posts remained inadequate in 2017. In terms of quality of care, only 37\% of {CHWs} correctly diagnosed key conditions in sick young infants at midline. {CHWs}' functional health literacy declined by over 70\% in basic aspects of case management during the study. Although the frequency of quarterly supportive supervision visits was above 80\% during 2013-2017, visits lacked support for managing sick young infants. Infrastructure and resources improved over the course of the {CBNC} programme implementation. However, embedding and scaling up the programme lacked the systems-thinking and attention to health system building-blocks needed to optimize service delivery.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {Background: Japan strives to strengthen its development cooperation by mobilizing various resources to assist partner countries advance on Universal Health Coverage by 2030. However, the involvement and roles of various actors for health are not clear. This study is the first to map Japan’s publicly funded projects by both Official Development Assistance ({ODA}) and other non-{ODA} public funds, and to describe the intervention areas. Further, the policy implications for country-specific cooperation strategies are discussed. The development cooperation for health in Vietnam is used as a case in this study. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of the Japanese publicly funded health projects that were being implemented in Vietnam during December 2016 was conducted. A framework of analysis based on the World Health Organization six health systems building blocks was adopted. The projects’ qualitative information was also assessed. Results: Overall, 68 projects implemented through Japanese public funding were analyzed. These 68 projects under 15 types of schemes were managed by seven different scheme-operating organizations and funded by five ministries. Of these 44 (64.7\%) were {ODA} and 24 (35.3\%) were non-{ODA} projects. Among the recategorized six building blocks of the health system, the largest proportion of projects was health service delivery (44\%), followed by health workforces (25\%), and health information systems (15\%). Almost half the projects were implemented together with the central hospitals as Vietnamese counterparts, which suggests that this is one area in which the specificities of Japanese cooperation are demonstrated. No synergetic effects of potential collaboration or harmonization among Japanese funded projects were captured. Conclusions: Several Japanese-funded projects addressed a wide range of health issues across all six building blocks of the health system in Vietnam. However, there is room for improvement in developing coordination and harmonization among the diversified Japanese projects. Establishing a country-specific mechanism for strategic coordination across Japanese ministries’ schemes can yield efficient and effective development cooperation for health. While Vietnam’s dependence on external funding is low, the importance of coordination across domestic actors of the donor countries can serve as an important lesson, especially in beneficiary countries with high external funding dependency. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective This study aimed to use qualitative interviews with surgical providers to explore challenges and solutions to providing surgical and anaesthesia care in Sierra Leone's hospitals. Design Data were collected through anonymous, semistructured interviews. We used a qualitative framework approach to analyse interview data and determine themes relating to challenges that were reported. Setting A purposive sample of 12 hospitals was selected throughout Sierra Leone to include district and referral hospitals of varying ownership (private, non-governmental organisation and government). Participants The most senior surgical provider available during each hospital site visit participated in a semistructured interview. A total of 12 interviews were conducted. Results Providers described both challenges and solutions relating to the following categories: equipment and supplies, access to services, human resources, infrastructure, management and patient factors. These challenges were found to affect surgical care in hospitals by delaying surgical care, decreasing operative capacity and decreasing quality of care. Providers identified not only the root causes of these challenges, but also the varied workarounds and solutions they employ to overcome them. Conclusion Surgical providers can offer important insights into challenges affecting surgical services in hospitals. Despite working in challenging environments with limited resources, providers have developed innovative solutions to improve surgical and anaesthesia care in hospitals in Sierra Leone. Qualitative research has an important role to play in improving understanding of the challenges facing surgeons in low-income countries. © 2022 {BMJ} Publishing Group. All rights reserved.},

This study investigated the {HFs} for availability and performance of {NCU}/{NSUs} in providing quality {IPNC}, and explored factors influencing the observed performance outcomes in Mtwara region, Tanzania. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using a follow-up explanatory mixed-methods approach. {HF}-based records and characteristics allowing for delivery of quality {IPNC} were reviewed first to establish the overall {HF} performance. The review findings were clarified by healthcare staff and managers through in-depth interviews ({IDIs}) and focus group discussions ({FGDs}). Results About 70.6\% (12/17) of surveyed {HFs} had at least one {NCU}/{NSU} room dedicated for delivery of {IPNC} but none had a fully established {NCUs}/{NSU}, and 74.7\% (3,600/4,819) of needy newborns were admitted/transferred in for management. Essential medicines such as tetracycline eye ointment were unavailable in 75\% (3/4) of the district hospitals ({DHs}). A disparity existed between the availability and functioning of equipment including infant radiant warmers (92\% vs 73\%). Governance, support from implementing patterns ({IPs}), and access to healthcare commodities were identified from qualitative inquiries as factors influencing the establishment and running of {NCUs}/{NSUs} at the {HFs} in Mtwara region, Tanzania. Conclusion Despite the positive progress, the establishment and performance of {NCUs}/{NSUs} in providing quality {IPNC} in {HFs} in Mtwara region is lagging behind the Tanzania neonatal care guideline requirements, particularly after the {IPs} of newborn health interventions completed their terms in 2016.

	abstract = {Background Diabetes, one of the major metabolic disorders, is rising in Bangladesh. Studies indicate there is inequality in prevalence and care-seeking behavior, which requires further exploration to understand the socioeconomic disparities in the pathophysiology of diabetes. This study examined the latest nationally representative estimates of diabetes prevalence, awareness, and management among adults aged 18 years and above in Bangladesh and its association with socioeconomic status in 2017-18. Methods We used the 2017-18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data. Diabetic status of 12,092 adults aged 18 years and above was measured in the survey using fasting plasma glucose levels. We applied multivariate logistic regressions to examine the role of socioeconomic status on diabetes prevalence, awareness, and management, after controlling for relevant covariates. Results Overall, 10\% of adults had diabetes in Bangladesh in 2017-18, with the highest prevalence of 16\% in the age group 55-64 years. Our analyses found statistically significant disparities by socioeconomic status in the prevalence of diabetes as well as the person's awareness of his/her diabetic condition. However, the effect of socioeconomic status on receiving anti-diabetic medication only approached significance (p = 0.07), and we found no significant association between socioeconomic status and control of diabetes. Conclusions We expect to see an 'accumulation' of the number of people with diabetes to continue in the coming years. The rising prevalence of diabetes is only the tip of an iceberg; a large number of people with uncontrolled diabetes and a lack of awareness of their condition will lead to increased morbidity and mortality, and that could be the real threat. Immediate measures to increase screening coverage and exploration of poor control of diabetes are required to mitigate the situation.  © 2022 Ahsan et al.

	abstract = {Background: Progress in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries ({LMICs}) and regions, is insufficient to achieve the Sustainable Developmental Goals by 2030. High-quality postnatal care ({PNC}) for mothers and neonates is crucial for mothers and babies, yet it remains the most neglected intervention on the continuum of maternal and child care. We aimed to estimate the associations between observable factors and high-quality maternal and neonatal {PNC} in pooled and country-specific analyses. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we used the most recent (2015–2022) Demographic and Health Surveys from 23 countries across Africa (n = 14), Southeast Asia (n = 3), Eastern Mediterranean (n = 2), Europe (n = 2), Americas (n = 1), and Western Pacific (n = 1). Women who, within the last 5 years, were aged 15–49 years at their last live birth that had delivered a singleton child were included. We identified eleven {PNC} behaviours recommended by the World Health Organization ({WHO}) to measure {PNC} quality, and applied thresholds to create binary outcomes for quality maternal and neonatal {PNC}. 15 factors were included in our analysis to assess their association with high-quality {PNC} for mothers and neonates in a series of single-adjusted and mutually adjusted logistic regression models, both in pooled and country-specific analysis. We also conducted two sets of subgroup analyses for place of residence and maternal age at last birth, and two sets of supplementary analyses to test the robustness of the results. Findings: Among 172,526 women and their most recent child, 41.42\% (40.93–41.91) received quality maternal {PNC} while 42.34\% (41.86–42.83) received quality neonatal {PNC}. In the pooled analysis, we found that the factors showing the strongest associations with quality maternal {PNC} were delivery by skilled birth attendants ({SBAs}) ({OR}: 4.92; 95\% {CI}: 4.32–5.59), four or more antenatal care ({ANC}) visits ({OR}: 1.69, 1.58–1.81), and institutional delivery ({OR}: 1.61; 1.46–1.78). Consistent results were found for all factors of quality newborn care (e.g., delivery by {SBA}: {OR}, 4.25; 3.75–4.81; four or more {ANC} visits: {OR}, 1.83; 1.70–1.96) except institutional delivery. The association between these leading factors and {PNC} quality were broadly consistent across countries. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses showed generally consistent results. Interpretation: Our study demonstrated that institutional delivery and frequent {ANC} visits had the strongest positive associations with quality {PNC} for both mothers and neonates. Our findings highlight that improvements to the quality of maternal and neonatal {PNC} in the {LMICs} we assessed are urgently needed to achieve ambitious maternal, newborn, and child health goals.

	abstract = {Background: Antenatal care ({ANC}) visits, institutional delivery, and postnatal care ({PNC}) visits are vital to improve the health of mothers and newborns. Despite improved access to these routine maternal and newborn health ({MNH}) services in Nepal, little is known about the cascade of health service coverage, particularly contact coverage, intervention-specific coverage, and quality-adjusted coverage of {MNH} services. This study examined the cascade of {MNH} services coverage, as well as social determinants associated with uptake of quality {MNH} services in Nepal. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data derived from the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey ({NDHS}) 2016, taking 1978 women aged 15–49 years who had a live birth in the 2 years preceding the survey. Three outcome variables were (i) four or more (4+) {ANC} visits, (ii) institutional delivery, and (iii) first {PNC} visit for mothers and newborns within 48 h of childbirth. We applied a cascade of health services coverage, including contact coverage, intervention-specific and quality-adjusted coverage, using a list of specific intervention components for each outcome variable. Several social determinants of health were included as independent variables to identify determinants of uptake of quality {MNH} services. We generated a quality score for each outcome variable and dichotomised the scores into two categories of “poor” and “optimal” quality, considering {\textgreater} 0.8 as a cut-off point. Binomial logistic regression was conducted and odds ratios ({OR}) were reported with 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}) at the significance level of p {\textless} 0.05 (two-tailed). Results: Contact coverage was higher than intervention-specific coverage and quality-adjusted coverage across all {MNH} services. Women with advantaged ethnicities or who had access to bank accounts had higher odds of receiving optimal quality {MNH} services, while women who speak the Maithili language and who had high birth order (≥ 4) had lower odds of receiving optimal quality {ANC} services. Women who received better quality {ANC} services had higher odds of receiving optimal quality institutional delivery. Women received poor quality {PNC} services if they were from remote provinces, had higher birth order and perceived problems when not having access to female providers. Conclusions: Women experiencing ethnic and social disadvantages, and from remote provinces received poor quality {MNH} services. The quality-adjusted coverage can be estimated using household survey data, such as demographic and health surveys, especially in countries with limited routine data. Policies and programs should focus on increasing quality of {MNH} services and targeting disadvantaged populations and those living in remote areas. Ensuring access to female health providers and improving the quality of earlier maternity visits could improve the quality of health care during the pregnancy-delivery-postnatal period. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Responsive primary health-care facilities are the foundation of resilient health systems, yet little is known about facility-level processes that contribute to the continuity of essential services during a crisis. This paper describes the aspects of primary health-care facility resilience to coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) in eight countries. Rapid-cycle phone surveys were conducted with health facility managers in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Chad, Guatemala, Guinea, Liberia, Malawi and Nigeria between August 2020 and December 2021. Responses were mapped to a validated health facility resilience framework and coded as binary variables for whether a facility demonstrated capacity in eight areas: removing barriers to accessing services, infection control, workforce, surge capacity, financing, critical infrastructure, risk communications, and medical supplies and equipment. These self-reported capacities were summarized nationally and validated with the ministries of health. The analysis of service volume data determined the outcome: maintenance of essential health services. Of primary health-care facilities, 1,453 were surveyed. Facilities maintained between 84\% and 97\% of the expected outpatient services, except for Bangladesh, where 69\% of the expected outpatient consultations were conducted between March 2020 and December 2021. For Burkina Faso, Chad, Guatemala, Guinea and Nigeria, critical infrastructure was the largest constraint in resilience capabilities (47\%, 14\%, 51\%, 9\% and 29\% of facilities demonstrated capacity, respectively). Medical supplies and equipment were the largest constraints for Liberia and Malawi (15\% and 48\% of facilities demonstrating capacity, respectively). In Bangladesh, the largest constraint was workforce and staffing, where 44\% of facilities experienced moderate to severe challenges with human resources during the pandemic. The largest constraints in facility resilience during {COVID}-19 were related to health systems building blocks. These challenges likely existed before the pandemic, suggesting the need for strategic investments and reforms in core capacities of comprehensive primary health-care systems to improve resilience to future shocks.  © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: In an effort to improve population health, many low- and middle-income countries ({LMICs}) have expanded access to public primary care facilities and removed user fees for services in these facilities. However, a growing literature suggests that many patients bypass nearby primary care facilities to seek care at more distant or higher-level facilities. Patients in urban areas, a growing segment of the population in {LMICs}, generally have more options for where to seek care than patients in rural areas. However, evidence on care-seeking trajectories and bypassing patterns in urban areas remains relatively scarce. Methods: We obtained a complete list of public health facilities and interviewed randomly selected informal sector households across 31 urban areas in Lusaka District, Zambia. All households and facilities listed were geocoded, and care-seeking trajectories mapped across the entire urban area. We analyzed three types of bypassing: i) not using health centers or health posts for primary care; ii) seeking care outside of the residential neighborhood; iii) directly seeking care at teaching hospitals. Results: A total of 620 households were interviewed, linked to 88 health facilities. Among 571 adults who had recently sought non-emergency care, 65\% sought care at a hospital. Among 141 children who recently sought care for diarrhea, cough, fever, or fast breathing, 34\% sought care at a hospital. 71\% of adults bypassed primary care facilities, 26\% bypassed health centers and hospitals close to them for more distant facilities, and 8\% directly sought care at a teaching hospital. Bypassing was also observed for 59\% of children, who were more likely to seek care outside of the formal care sector, with 21\% of children treated at drug shops or pharmacies. Conclusions: The results presented here strongly highlight the complexity of urban health systems. Most adult patients in Lusaka do not use public primary health facilities for non-emergency care, and heavily rely on pharmacies and drug shops for treatment of children. Major efforts will likely be needed if the government wants to instate health centers as the principal primary care access point in this setting. © 2022, The Author(s).},

More than half of the world's countries are not on track to reach {SDG} 3.4, and the {COVID}-19 crisis has hampered the delivery of essential {NCD} services globally, which means the premature death of millions of people and indicates the need for capacity building for health systems.

Following the quantitative phase, a qualitative phase focused on the low-capacity points revealed by the tool. The causes of low capacity were investigated, as well as potential interventions to improve capacity. The developed tool comprises six main domains and eighteen subdomains, including (Governance, Organizational Management, Human Resources Management, Financial Management, Program Management, and Relations Management) which verified validity and reliability. In seven separate National Center for Non-Communicable Disease units, the organizational capacity was measured using the designed tool. (Cardiovascular disease and hypertension; diabetes; chronic respiratory disease; obesity and physical activity; tobacco and alcohol; nutrition; and cancers). The organizational management dimensions and the sub-dimensions of the organizational structure of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education and units affiliated with the national center, in all cases, were almost one of the main challenges that affected the country's capacity to fight against {NCDs}. However, all units had a relatively good situation in terms of governance (mission statement, vision, and written strategic plan). The content analysis of experts' opinions on the low-capacity subdomains highlighted challenges and recommended capacity-building interventions. Transparency in methods and processes is necessary to allocate funding among various health programs and evaluate their effects through cost-effectiveness indicators. This study identified weak points or areas where capacity building is required. The root causes of low capacity and interventions to build capacity are listed in each dimension of the tool. Some of the proposed interventions, such as strengthening organizational structures, have the potential to impact other domains. Improving organizational capacity for {NCDs} can assist countries to achieve national and global goals with greater efficiency.  © 2023 Bakhtiari et al.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Globally, the coronavirus ({COVID}-19) pandemic poses fundamental challenges in everyday life. Various controlling measures, including nationwide lockdowns, movement restrictions, travel bans, social distancing, and improved hygiene practices, have been widely introduced to curtail transmission of the disease. Notably, these measures have affected the execution of population health research that typically involves face-to-face data collection. This paper details a subjective reflective account of the challenges and mitigating strategies in conducting a nationwide study during the {COVID}-19 pandemic in 2021. Challenges and strategies: The research team faced a wide range of challenges in conducting this study. The major categories of challenges were defined as follows: (i) challenges relating to the {COVID}-19 pandemic, such as insufficient access to field sites; (ii) challenges related to contextual factors, such as cultural and gender sensitivity and extreme weather events; and (iii) challenges related to data quality and validity. The key mitigating strategies to overcoming these challenges included engaging a local-level field supervisor, hiring data collectors from respective study sites, incorporating team members’ reviews of literature and experts’ views to develop research instruments, modifying original research instruments, organizing regular meetings and debriefing, adjusting field operation plans, building gender-sensitive teams, understanding local norms and adopting culturally appropriate dress codes, and conducting interviews in local languages. Conclusions: This paper concludes that despite several {COVID}-19-related challenges coupled with contextual factors, data were successfully collected through timely and successful adaptations of several mitigating strategies. The strategies adopted in this study may be useful for overcoming unforeseeable challenges in planning and conducting future population-based health research in similar circumstances elsewhere. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Ethiopia is striving to reduce unmet need for family planning ({FP}) and implementation of the health extension program ({HEP}) is one of the major actions that the country took to address health issues of rural communities including {FP}. However, there is limited published evidence demonstrating the role of {HEP} in reducing the unmet need of married rural women for {FP}. The aim of this study is to estimate the role of {HEP} in reducing unmet need for {FP} in rural Ethiopia. Methods: This paper is based on data extracted from a national rural {HEP} assessment that covered all regions of Ethiopia. We identified 4991 eligible married women both from agrarian and pastoralist settings. The role of {HEP} was measured by the exposure of eligible women to {FP} services through the implementation of {HEP} packages. We used descriptive statistics to summarize different variables and used logistic regression to model the unmet need for {FP}. Results: The overall prevalence of unmet need for {FP} among married rural Ethiopian women was 22.41\%, contraceptive prevalence rate ({CPR}) was 44.60\%, and the total demand for {FP} was 60.86\%. Women exposed to {HEP} had a lower level of unmet need (4.82\%), a higher demand for {FP} (37.78\%) and a higher {CPR} (24.93\%) compared to women unexposed to {HEP}. Having exposure to {FP} services (adjusted odds ratio ({AOR}) = 0.46, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.37–0.59), having level {IV} Health Extension Workers ({HEWs}) in the catchment health post ({AOR} = 0.80, 95\% {CI} 0.67–0.95) and older age are significantly associated with lower levels of unmet need for {FP}. Having more children ({AOR} = 2.11, 95\% {CI} 1.67–2.65) and better awareness of the husband about the availability of {FP} services ({AOR} = 1.22, 95\% {CI} 1.01–1.48) were associated with a higher likelihood of an unmet need for {FP}. Conclusion: The unmet need for family planning is high in rural Ethiopia in general and among women who do not have exposure to {HEP} packages in particular. Assigning a better-qualified health worker at the health post, reaching out to pastoralist women, maximizing opportunities to counsel rural women about {FP} during any contact with {HEWs}, and increasing positive attitudes of husbands towards {FP} use are likely to have positive impacts in reducing the unmet need for {FP} of rural women. © 2022, The Author(s).},

We conducted a cross-sectional mixed-methods study in Nairobi informal settlements. The aim was to investigate knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of this marginalized community, and to identify, with a bottom-up approach, the most appropriate interventions to increase the utilization of {HIV}/{STIs} services. Preliminary qualitative research was used to draw questionnaires, which assessed: {STIs}/{HIV}/{AIDS} knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours; access and barriers to {STIs}/{HIV}/{AIDS} services; perceived quality of services; the impact of {COVID}-19. One thousand and fifty-four respondents completed the questionnaire. 48.3\% were youth in the community, 23\% youth in school, 16.8\% young mothers, 6.9\% drug users and 5\% people attending a technical-vocational training. We found unsatisfactory knowledge of {STIs}/{HIV}/{AIDS} transmission and prevention, and low condom use, mainly due to difficult access, poverty, and gender-based violence. We also found limited use of health services, and lack of trust due to poor attitude of the staff. {COVID}-19 has widened barriers to access to health services. To reach this population, it is necessary to implement educational interventions, facilitate access to free condoms, and train health centre staff to be more welcoming. Respondents found proximity strategies more efficient, including door-to-door testing and community outreach. © 2023 Istituto Superiore di Sanita. All rights reserved.},

Patterns of treatment-seeking behavior can differ by access to health care, and perceptions of disease severity and symptoms. We evaluated the association between self-reported symptoms at last illness and the level of treatment-seeking behaviors. We analyzed cross-sectional data from 1,037 participants from the lowlands and highlands of Western Kenya from 2015 using logistic regression models. There was considerable heterogeneity in the symptoms and treatment-seeking behaviors reported among individuals who were febrile at their last illness. A greater number of self-reported categories of symptoms tended to be associated with a higher likelihood of treatment-seeking in both sites. Participants were significantly more likely to seek treatment if they reported fever, aches, and digestive symptoms at last illness than just fever and aches or fever alone, but the frequency of treatment-seeking for fever in combination with aches and respiratory symptoms did not follow a consistent pattern. Among those who sought treatment, most used a formal source, but the patterns were inconsistent across sites and by the number of symptoms categories. Understanding the drivers of treatment-seeking behavior after febrile illness is important to control and treat infectious diseases in Kenya.

	abstract = {Background: Recent global reports highlighted the importance of addressing the quality of care in all settings including fragile and conflict-affected situations ({FCS}), as a central strategy for the attainment of sustainable development goals and universal health coverage. Increased mortality burden in {FCS} reflects the inability to provide routine services of good quality. There is also paucity of research documenting the impact of conflict on the quality of care within fragile states including disparities in service delivery. This study addresses this measurement gap by examining disparities in the quality of primary healthcare services in four conflict-affected fragile states using proxy indicators. Methods: A secondary analysis of publicly available data sources was performed in four conflict-affected fragile states: Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, and Nigeria. Two main databases were utilized: the Demographic Health Survey and the Uppsala Conflict Data Program for information on components of care and conflict events, respectively. Three equity measures were computed for each country: absolute difference, concentration index, and coefficients of mixed-effects logistic regression. Each computed measure was then compared according to the intensity of organized violence events at the neighborhood level. Results: Overall, the four studied countries had poor quality of {PHC} services, with considerable subnational variation in the quality index. Poor quality of {PHC} services was not only limited to neighborhoods where medium or high intensity conflict was recorded but was also likely to be observed in neighborhoods with no or low intensity conflict. Both economic and educational disparities were observed in individual quality components in both categories of conflict intensity. Conclusion: Each of the four conflict-affected countries had an overall poor quality of {PHC} services with both economic and educational disparities in the individual components of the quality index, regardless of conflict intensity. Multi-sectoral efforts are needed to improve the quality of care and disparities in these settings, without a limited focus on sub-national areas where medium or high intensity conflict is recorded. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Smoking rates remain high in Vietnam, particularly among people living with {HIV}/{AIDS} ({PLWH}), but tobacco cessation services are not available in outpatient {HIV} clinics ({OPCs}). The research team is conducting a type {II} hybrid randomized controlled trial ({RCT}) comparing the cost-effectiveness of three tobacco cessation interventions among {PLWH} receiving care in {HIV} clinics in Vietnam. The study is simultaneously evaluating the implementation processes and outcomes of strategies aimed at increasing the implementation of tobacco dependence treatment ({TDT}) in the context of {HIV} care. This paper describes the systematic, theory-driven process of adapting intervention components and implementation strategies with demonstrated effectiveness in high-income countries, and more recently in Vietnam, to a new population (i.e., {PLWH}) and new clinical setting, prior to launching the trial. Methods: Data collection and analyses were guided by two implementation science frameworks and the socio-ecological model. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 health care providers and 24 patients in three {OPCs}. Workflow analyses were conducted in each {OPC}. Qualitative data were analyzed using rapid qualitative analysis procedures. Based on findings, components of the intervention and implementation strategies were adapted, followed by a 3-month pilot study in one {OPC} with 16 patients randomized to one of two intervention arms. Results: The primary adaptations included modifying the {TDT} intervention counseling content to address barriers to quitting among {PLWH} and Vietnamese sociocultural norms that support smoking cessation. Implementation strategies (i.e., training and system changes) were adapted to respond to provider- and clinic-level determinants of implementation effectiveness (e.g., knowledge gaps, {OPC} resource constraints, staffing structure, compatibility). Conclusions: Adaptations were facilitated through a mixed method, stakeholder (patient and health care provider, district health leader)-engaged evaluation of context-specific influences on intervention and implementation effectiveness. This data-driven approach to refining and adapting components aimed to optimize intervention effectiveness and implementation in the context of {HIV} care. Balancing pragmatism with rigor through the use of rapid analysis procedures and multiple methods increased the feasibility of the adaptation process.

Design, setting and analysis A review of national maternal death surveillance data was conducted. The data were obtained through medical record review and verbal autopsies of each death. Generalised structural equation modelling was employed to simultaneously examine the relationships among exogenous, mediating (urban/rural residence) and endogenous variables. Outcome Magnitude and factors related to the location of maternal death. Participants A total of 4316 maternal deaths were reviewed from 2013 to 2020. Results Facility death constitutes 69.0\% of maternal deaths in the reporting period followed by home death and death while in transit, each contributing to 17.0\% and 13.6\% of maternal deaths, respectively. Educational status has a positive direct effect on death occurring at home (β=0.42, 95\% {CI} 0.22 to 0.66), obstetric haemorrhage has a direct positive effect on deaths occurring at home (β=0.41, 95\% {CI} 0.04 to 0.80) and death in transit (β=0.68, 95\% {CI} 0.48 to 0.87), while it has a direct negative effect on death occurring at a health facility (β=-0.60, 95\% {CI} -0.77 to -0.44). Moreover, unanticipated management of complication has a positive direct (β=0.99, 95\% {CI} 0.34 to 1.63), indirect (β=0.05, 95\% {CI} 0.04 to 0.07) and total (β=1.04, 95\% {CI} 0.38 to 1.70) effect on facility death. Residence is a mediator variable and is associated with all places of death. It has a connection with facility death (β=-0.70, 95\% {CI} -0.95 to -0.46), death during transit (β=0.51, 95\% {CI} 0.20 to 0.83) and death at home (β=0.85, 95\% {CI} 0.54 to 1.17). Conclusion Almost 7 in 10 maternal deaths occurred at the health facility. Sociodemographic factors, medical causes of death and non-medical causes of death mediated by residence were factors associated with the place of death. Thus, factors related to the place of death should be considered as an area of intervention to mitigate preventable maternal death that occurred in different settings.  © 2022 Emergency Medicine Journal.

	abstract = {Access to electricity is a prerequisite for development, included in both the Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union’s Agenda 2063. Still, universal access to electricity is elusive to large parts of the global population. In Somalia, approximately one-third of the population has access to electricity. The country is unique among non-island countries as it has no centralized grid network. This paper applies a geospatial electrification model to examine paths towards universal access to electricity in Somalia under different timelines and with regard to different levels of myopia in the modeling process. This extends the previous scientific literature on geospatial electrification modeling by studying the effect of myopia for the first time and simultaneously presenting the first geospatial electrification analysis focused on Somalia. Using the Open Source Spatial Electrification Tool ({OnSSET}), the least-cost electrification options towards 2030 and 2040, respectively, are compared. We find that under the shorter timeline, a deployment of mini-grids and stand-alone {PV} technologies alone provides the least-cost option under all but one scenario. However, under the longer timeline, the construction of a national transmission backbone would lower overall costs if there is high demand growth and/or low cost of centralized grid electricity generation. We also compare different levels of myopia in the modeling process. Here, {OnSSET} is first run directly until 2040, then in five-year time-steps and annual time-steps. We find that running the model directly until 2040 leads to the lowest costs overall. Running the model myopically leads to a sub-optimal, more costly technology mix, with a lock-in effect towards stand-alone systems. On the other hand, the myopic approach does provide additional insights into the development of the system over time. We find that longer-term planning favors the centralized grid network, whereas short-sighted myopic planning can lead to higher costs in the long term and a technology mix with a higher share of stand-alone {PV}. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Introduction: In Bangladesh, sexually transmitted infection ({STI}) services are available for all populations in public health facilities. However, {STI} services for key populations ({KPs}) at risk of {HIV} need specifically designed approaches that are predominantly administered to {KPs} through donor-supported service centers operated by non-government organizations ({NGOs}) and community-based organisations ({CBOs}). However, the steady decline in donor funding warrants a sustainable transition of {STI} services for the {KPs} into public health facilities. This article aimed to explore the service availability and readiness of public health facilities to provide {STI} services for the {KPs}. Methods: This qualitative study explored the service availability and readiness of public health facilities in three districts of Bangladesh by adapting the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment tool. We conducted 34 in-depth interviews,11 focus group discussions with {KPs}, and 29 key-informant interviews with healthcare providers, researchers, programme implementers and policy planners, in addition to series of direct observations at the public healthcare facilities. Data were analysed through thematic analysis, and categorised in relation to the {WHO} building blocks. Results: This study revealed that the public health system was generally not ready to serve the {KPs}’ needs in terms of providing them with quality {STI} services. The ‘service delivery’ component, which is the most crucial facet of the public health system, was not ready to provide {STI} services to {KPs}. Findings also indicated that health workforce availability was limited in the primary and secondary healthcare layers but adequate in the tertiary layer, but needed to be oriented on providing culturally sensitised treatment. Counseling, an essential component of {STI} services, was neither ready nor available. However, health information systems and a few other components were partially ready, although this warrants systematic approaches to address these challenges. Conclusion: The findings show that public health facilities are yet to be fully ready to render {STI} services to {KPs}, especially in terms of service delivery and human and health resources. Therefore, it is not only integral to mobilize communities towards the uptake of public health services, but health systems need to be prepared to cater to their needs. © 2023, {BioMed} Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

As one of the largest global public health initiatives, individuals involved with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative ({GPEI}) have learned many important lessons about service delivery. We identified contributors and challenges to delivering health services at national and subnational levels using experiences from the {GPEI}. We described strategies used to strengthen service delivery and draw lessons that could be applicable to achieving {UHC}. Methods: Online cross-sectional surveys based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research ({CFIR}) domains and socioecological model were conducted from 2018–2019. Data were analyzed using an embedded mixed methods approach. Frequencies of the contributors and challenges to service delivery by levels of involvement were estimated. Chi-square tests of independence were used to assess unadjusted associations among categorical outcome variables. Logistic regressions were used to examine the association between respondent characteristics and contributors to successful implementation or implementation challenges. Horizontal analysis of free text responses by {CFIR} domain was done to contextualize the quantitative results. Results: Three thousand nine hundred fifty-five people responded to the online survey which generated 3,659 valid responses. Among these, 887 (24.2\%) reported involvement in service delivery at the global, national, or subnational level with more than 90\% involved at subnational levels. The main internal contributor of strengthened service delivery was the process of conducting activities (48\%); working in frontline role had higher odds of identifying the process of conducting activities as the main internal contributor ({AOR}: 1.22, p = 0.687). The main external contributor was the social environment (42.5\%); having 10–14 years of polio program implementation was significantly associated with identifying the social environment as the main external contributor to strengthened service delivery ({AOR}: 1.61, p = 0.038). The most frequent implementation challenge was the external environment (56\%); working in Eastern Mediterranean region was almost 4 times more likely to identify the external environment as the major challenge in service delivery strengthening ({AOR}:3.59, p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusion: Priority actions to improve service delivery include: adopt strategies to systematically reach hard-to-reach populations, expand disease-focused programs to support broader primary healthcare priorities, maximize community outreach strategies to reach broader age groups, build community trust in health workers and develop multisectoral leadership for collaboration. Achieving {UHC} is contingent on strengthened subnational service delivery. © 2022, The Author(s).},

We use nationally representative administrative data from Tanzania's Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}). We apply a series of logistic and ordered logistic regression analyses and find that gender congruence is correlated with both family planning service recipients' and care providers' communication behaviors. Despite confirming the principal tenets of the theory of representative bureaucracy, we also document mixed results when considering the moderating effects of service recipients' prior experience with service on communication behaviors. Taken together, representation has a positive effect on female providers' communication behavior. Yet, for service recipients, its benefits are contingent upon the type of outcome assessed and prior experience with service. We discuss the policy and practical implications of our study in the context of the benefits and limits of representation. © 2023 American Society for Public Administration.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To achieve universal health coverage, adequate geographic access to quality healthcare services is vital and should be characterized periodically to support planning. However, in Kenya, previous assessments of geographic accessibility have relied on public health facility lists only, assembled several years ago. Here, for the first time we assemble a geocoded list of public and private health facilities in 2021 and make use of this updated list to interrogate geographical accessibility to all health providers. Methods: Existing health provider lists in Kenya were accessed, merged, cleaned, harmonized, and assigned a unique geospatial location. The resultant master list was combined with road network, land use, topography, travel barriers and healthcare-seeking behavior within a geospatial framework to estimate travel time to the nearest (i) private, (ii) public, and (iii) both (public and private-{PP}) health facilities through a travel scenario involving walking, bicycling and motorized transport. The proportion of the population within 1 h and outside 2-h was computed at 300 × 300 spatial resolution and aggregated at subnational units used for decision-making. Areas with a high disease prevalence for common infections that were outside 1-h catchment (dual burden) were also identified to guide prioritization. Results: The combined database contained 13,579 health facilities, both in the public (55.5\%) and private-for-profit sector (44.5\%) in 2021. The private health facilities' distribution was skewed toward the urban counties. Nationally, average travel time to the nearest health facility was 130, 254, and 128 min while the population within 1-h was 89.4, 80.5, and 89.6\% for the public, private and {PP} health facility, respectively. The population outside 2-h were 6\% for public and {PP} and 11\% for the private sector. Mean travel time across counties was heterogeneous, while the population within 1-h ranged between 38 and 100\% in both the public sector and {PP}. Counties in northwest and southeast Kenya had a dual burden. Conclusion: Continuous updating and geocoding of health facilities will facilitate an improved understanding of healthcare gaps for planning. Heterogeneities in geographical access continue to persist, with some areas having a dual burden and should be prioritized toward reducing health inequities and attaining universal health coverage.

	abstract = {Background and objective The Ministry of Health of Lesotho and Partners In Health piloted the Lesotho National Primary Health Care Reform ({LPHCR}) from July 2014 to June 2017 to improve quality and quantity of service delivery and enhance health system management. This initiative included improvement of routine health information systems ({RHISs}) to map disease burden and reinforce data utilisation for clinical quality improvement. Methods and analysis The {WHO} Data Quality Assurance framework's core indicators were used to compare the completeness of health data before versus after the {LPHCR} in 60 health centres and 6 hospitals across four districts. To examine change in data completeness, we conducted an interrupted time series analysis using multivariable logistic mixed-effects regression. Additionally, we conducted 25 key informant interviews with healthcare workers ({HCWs}) at the different levels of Lesotho's health system, following a purposive sampling approach. Interviews were analysed using deductive coding based on the Performance of Routine Information System Management framework, which inspected organisational, technical and behavioural factors influencing {RHIS} processes and outputs associated with the {LPHCR}. Results In multivariable analyses, trends in monthly data completion rate were higher after versus before the {LPHCR} for: documenting first antenatal care visit (adjusted {OR} ({AOR}): 1.24, 95\% {CI}: 1.14 to 1.36) and institutional delivery ({AOR}: 1.19, 95\% {CI}: 1.07 to 1.32). When discussing processes, {HCWs} highlighted the value of establishing clear roles and responsibilities in reporting under a new organisational structure, improved community programmes among district health management teams, and enhanced data sharing and monitoring by districts. Conclusion The Ministry of Health had a strong data completion rate pre-{LPHCR}, which was sustained throughout the {LPHCR} despite increased service utilisation. The data completion rate was optimised through improved behavioural, technical and organisational factors introduced as part of the {LPHCR}. © 2023 {BMJ} Publishing Group. All rights reserved.},

Therefore, this study intended to determine spatial pattern and factors affecting institutional delivery among women who had live birth in Ethiopia within five years preceding survey. Method Data from 2019 Ethiopian demographic and health survey were used. Taking into account the nested structure of the data, multilevel logistic regression analysis has been employed to a nationally representative sample of 5753 women nested with in 305 communities/clusters. Result A significant heterogeneity was observed between clusters for institutional delivery which explains about 57\% of the total variation. Individual-level variables: primary education ({OR} = 1.8: 95\% {CI}: 1.44–2.26), secondary education ({OR} = 3.65: 95\% {CI}: 2.19–6.1), diploma and higher ({OR} = 2.74: 95\% {CI}: 1.02–7.34), women who had both Radio and Television were 4.6 times ({OR} = 4.6; 95\% {CI}: 2.52, 8.45), four and above Antenatal visit ({AOR} = 2.72, 95\% {CI}:2.2, 3.34), rich wealth index ({OR} = 2.22; 95\% {CI}: 1.62–2.99), birth interval for 18 to 33 months ({OR} = 1.8; 95\% {CI}: 1.19, 2.92), and women who space birth for 33 and above months ({OR} = 2.02; 95\% {CI}: 1.3, 3.12) were associated with institutional delivery. Community level variables, community high proportion of antenatal visit ({OR} = 4.68; 95\% {CI}: 4.13–5.30), and Region were associated with institutional delivery. Conclusion A clustered pattern of areas with low institutional delivery was observed in Ethiopia. Both individual and community level factors found significantly associated with institutional delivery theses showed the need for community women education through health extension programs and community health workers.

	abstract = {Introduction: incomplete childhood immunization is a significant public health challenge as children continue to succumb to vaccine-preventable diseases in most developing countries. Studies on childhood immunization conducted in Eswatini are sparse. Therefore, the present study assessed the prevalence of incomplete childhood immunization in Eswatini and further explored associated factors among children aged 12 to 35 months. Methods: using data from Eswatini multiple indicator cluster survey 5 ({EMICS}5), a cross-sectional analysis with 978 children aged 12 to 35 months was conducted. This is the latest available data in the public domain. The survey was conducted from July 2014 to October 2014. The primary outcome variable was incomplete immunization. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine the association between selected variables and incomplete immunization. Results: the mean age of the children was 23.45±6.92 months, 50.2\% were boys, and 74.1\% lived in rural areas. The prevalence of incomplete immunization was 31.5\%. Increased child´s age, being a girl, increased caregiver´s age, and increased number of children under-five years in the household and residing in the Manzini or Hhohho region were significantly associated with incomplete immunization. Conclusion: the {EMICS} 5 revealed a high prevalence of incomplete immunization in Eswatini. Health promotion activities such as empowering women and caregivers of children through health education about child health should be emphasized. Where feasible, outreach services and door-to-door immunization should be strengthened to improve immunization coverage in the country and cover dropouts. © Thatho Nolwazi Dlamini et al.},

Through the lens of strategic approach for good data management practices, the extent to which healthcare data is leveraged for {AI} applications was assessed. As the main body for collecting, archiving, managing, and sharing health data in Ethiopia, the national data management center for health ({NDMC}) at the Ethiopian public health Institute ({EPHI}) is considered for this study. To guide the study, the {FAIR} (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles; the key elements of data strategy by Inner City Fund ({ICF}) International Inc: data governance, data architecture, needs assessment, future state vision and roadmap, organizational analytics maturity assessment; and data from Papers with Code (data in Meta Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) Research), more specifically, State-of-the-Art ({SOTA}) benchmarks, {AI} models, use cases, libraries, and frameworks, were used to assess the extent to which {NDMC} data activities support de-ployment of {AI} applications. From the analysis of primary and secondary sources, as well as based on the principles and frameworks, the following key findings were reported: {NDMC} by and large pursues data strategy as outlined by {ICF} International, except two key elements that could not be detected from the review and an in-person discussion and these are: future state vision and roadmap, organizational analytics maturity assessment. When the {FAIR} principle is used as a guide, the data and metadata at {NDMC} do not strictly adhere to community standards in bio-medical sciences that promote findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. In regard to the {SOTA} benchmarks, {NDMC}, data analytics and reporting being one of its core charges, mainly relies on descriptive and inferential statistical methods to generate data reports and no {AI}, Machine Learning ({ML}), or Deep Learning ({DL}) applications were identified that could offer more predictive and prescriptive insights. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland {AG}.},

	abstract = {Background: Many countries implementing pro-poor reforms to expand subsidized health care, especially for the poor, recognize that high-quality healthcare, and not just access alone, is necessary to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. As the poor are more likely to use low quality health services, measures to improve access to health care need to emphasise quality as the cornerstone to achieving equity goals. Current methods to evaluate health systems financing equity fail to take into account measures of quality. This paper aims to provide a worked example of how to adapt a popular quantitative approach, Benefit Incidence Analysis ({BIA}), to incorporate a quality weighting into the computation of public subsidies for health care. Methods: We used a dataset consisting of a sample of households surveyed in 10 provinces of Indonesia in early-2018. In parallel, a survey of public health facilities was conducted in the same geographical areas, and information about health facility infrastructure and basic equipment was collected. In each facility, an index of service readiness was computed as a measure of quality. Individuals who reported visiting a primary health care facility in the month before the interview were matched to their chosen facility. Standard {BIA} and an extended {BIA} that adjusts for service quality were conducted. Results: Quality scores were relatively high across all facilities, with an average of 82\%. Scores for basic equipment were highest, with an average score of 99\% compared to essential medicines with an average score of 60\%. Our findings from the quality-weighted {BIA} show that the distribution of subsidies for public primary health care facilities became less ‘pro-poor’ while private clinics became more ‘pro-rich’ after accounting for quality of care. Overall the distribution of subsidies became significantly pro-rich ({CI} = 0.037). Conclusions: Routine collection of quality indicators that can be linked to individuals is needed to enable a comprehensive understanding of individuals’ pathways of care. From a policy perspective, accounting for quality of care in health financing assessment is crucial in a context where quality of care is a nationwide issue. In such a context, any health financing performance assessment is likely to be biased if quality is not accounted for. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {To improve access to affordable primary health care and preventive services, in 2019 Rwanda’s Ministry of Health inaugurated eight laboratory-equipped second-generation health posts ({SGHPs}) in the Bugesera District. Patient fees through Rwanda’s insurance system (mutuelles) funded most operational costs through a public–private partnership. This prospective, controlled trial evaluated the posts’ impact and cost-effectiveness. Our evaluation matched the rural cells containing these posts to eight control cells in Bugesera without formal health posts. We assessed costs using 2 years of financial data; accessed use statistics at {SGHPs}, health centers, and in the international literature; interviewed 1,952 randomly selected residents; conducted eight focus groups; and performed difference-in-differences regressions and survival analyses. Second-generation health posts increased primary care use by 1.83 outpatient visits per person per year (P, 0.0001). Of the 10 prevention indicators compared with trends, two improved significantly with {SGHPs} (two showed nonsignificant improvements), and one indicator experienced a significant deterioration. Second-generation health posts generated health improvements at a low cost and achieved a small, but favorable, 5\% margin of revenues over financial costs. Second-generation health posts produced a very favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of only \$101 per disability-adjusted life year averted—only 13\% of Rwanda’s per-capita gross national income. In conclusion, {SGHPs} improved substantially the quantity of affordable outpatient care per person. However, net impacts on quality and completeness of care and prevention, although favorable, were small. For further improvements in access and quality of care, Rwanda’s health authorities may wish to incentivize quality and strengthen coordination with other health system components.

However, the availability and accessibility of health facilities and their impacts on {LAMC} utilisation (implant, intrauterine devices, sterilisation) in low- and middle-income countries is an understudied topic. This study aimed to examine the association between the availability and readiness of health facilities and the use of {LAMC} in Bangladesh. Methods: In this survey study, we linked the 2017/18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data with the 2017 Bangladesh Health Facility Survey data using the administrative-boundary linkage method. Mixed-effect multilevel logistic regressions were conducted. The sample comprised 10,938 married women of 15–49 years age range who were fertile but did not desire a child within 2 years of the date of survey. The outcome variable was the current use of {LAMC} (yes, no), and the explanatory variables were health facility-, individual-, household- and community-level factors. Results: Nearly 34\% of participants used {LAMCs} with significant variations across areas in Bangladesh. The average scores of the health facility management and health facility infrastructure were 0.79 and 0.83, respectively. Of the facilities where {LAMCs} were available, 69\% of them were functional and ready to provide {LAMCs} to the respondents. The increase in scores for the management (adjusted odds ratio ({aOR}), 1.59; 95\% {CI}, 1.21–2.42) and infrastructure ({aOR}, 1.44; 95\% {CI}, 1.01–1.69) of health facilities was positively associated with the overall uptake of {LAMC}. For per unit increase in the availability and readiness scores to provide {LAMC} at the nearest health facilities, the {aORs} for women to report using {LAMC} were 2.16 (95\% {CI}, 1.18–3.21) and 1.74 (95\% {CI}, 1.15–3.20), respectively. A nearly 27\% decline in the likelihood of {LAMC} uptake was observed for every kilometre increase in the average regional-level distance between women’s homes and the nearest health facilities. Conclusion: The proximity of health facilities and their improved management, infrastructure, and readiness to provide {LAMCs} to women significantly increase their uptake. Policies and programs should prioritise improving health facility readiness to increase {LAMC} uptake. © 2022, The Author(s).},

This systematic literature review provides a meta-analysis of {HIV} testing disruptions and a synthesis of {HIV}/{AIDS} services adapted during {COVID}-19. We searched scholarly databases from 01 January 2020 to 30 June 2022 using key terms on {HIV} testing rates and services during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. The process of how the included articles were identified, selected, appraised, and synthesised was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ({PRISMA}) guidelines.

We found that {HIV} testing decreased by 37\% during the search period because of the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Service providers adopted novel strategies to support remote service delivery by expanding community antiretroviral therapy dispensing, setting up primary care outreach points, and instituting multi-month dispensing services to sustain client care. Therefore, service providers and policymakers should explore alternative strategies to increase {HIV} testing rates impacted by {COVID}-19 and leverage funding to continue providing the identified adapted services. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Our findings suggest modest, positive associations between malaria in pregnancy quality and {ITN} use and {IPTp}-2 uptake across pooled models and for most studied countries, with evidence of heterogeneity in the strength of associations and relevant confounding factors. Antenatal care quality generally was not associated with the study outcomes, although a positive interaction with malaria in pregnancy quality was present for pooled {ITN} use models. The improved quality of malaria services delivered during formal antenatal care can help address low coverage and usage rates of preventive malaria interventions in pregnancy and childhood. Study findings may be used to target quality improvement efforts at the sub-national level. Study methods may be adapted to identify low-performing facilities for intervention and adaption to other areas of care, such as {HIV}/{AIDS}, child immunizations, and postnatal care. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Essential Emergency and Critical Care ({EECC}) is a novel approach to the care of critically ill patients, focusing on first-tier, effective, low-cost, life-saving care and designed to be feasible even in low-resourced and low-staffed settings. This is distinct from advanced critical care, usually conducted in {ICUs} with specialised staff, facilities and technologies. This paper estimates the incremental cost of {EECC} and advanced critical care for the planning of care for critically ill patients in Tanzania and Kenya. The incremental costing took a health systems perspective. A normative approach based on the ingredients defined through the recently published global consensus on {EECC} was used. The setting was a district hospital in which the patient is provided with the definitive care typically provided at that level for their condition. Quantification of resource use was based on {COVID}-19 as a tracer condition using clinical expertise. Local prices were used where available, and all costs were converted to {USD}2020. The costs per patient day of {EECC} is estimated to be 1 {USD}, 11 {USD} and 33 {USD} in Tanzania and 2 {USD}, 14 {USD} and 37 {USD} in Kenya, for moderate, severe and critical {COVID}-19 patients respectively. The cost per patient day of advanced critical care is estimated to be 13 {USD} and 294 {USD} in Tanzania and {USD} 17 {USD} and 345 {USD} in Kenya for severe and critical {COVID}-19 patients, respectively. {EECC} is a novel approach for providing the essential care to all critically ill patients. The low costs and lower tech approach inherent in delivering {EECC} mean that {EECC} could be provided to many and suggests that prioritizing {EECC} over {ACC} may be a rational approach when resources are limited.

The Community and Provider driven Social Accountability Intervention ({CaPSAI}) Project contributes to the evidence on the effects of social accountability processes in the context of a family planning and contraceptive programme. Methods: A quasi-experimental study utilizing an interrupted time series design with a control group ({ITS}-{CG}) was conducted to determine the actual number of new users of contraception amongst women 15–49 years old in eight intervention and eight control facilities per country in Ghana and Tanzania. A standardized facility audit questionnaire was used to collect facility data and completed every year in both intervention and control groups in each country from 2018–2020. Results: In Ghana, the two-segmented Poisson Generalized Estimating Equation ({GEE}) model demonstrated no statistically significant difference at post-intervention, between the intervention and control facilities, in the level of uptake of contraceptives (excess level) (p-value = 0.07) or in the rate of change (excess rate) in uptake (p-value = 0.07) after adjusting for baseline differences. Similarly, in Tanzania, there was no statistical difference between intervention and control facilities, in the level of uptake of contraceptives (excess level) (p-value = 0.20), with the rate of change in uptake (p-value = 0.05) after adjusting for the baseline differences. There was no statistical difference in the level of or rate of change in uptake in the two groups in a sensitivity analysis excluding new users recruited in outreach activities in Tanzania. Conclusions: The {CAPSAI} project intervention did not result in a statistically significant increase in uptake of contraceptives as measured by the number of or increase in new users. In evaluating the impact of the intervention on the intermediate outcomes such as self-efficacy among service users, trust and countervailing power among social groups/networks, and responsiveness of service providers, cases of change and process evaluation should be considered.

Design Cross-sectional analysis of data from Nigeria's 2018 Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}). Setting Nigeria. Participants 11 536 children aged 6-59 months from randomly selected households were eligible for participation, of whom 11 142 had complete and valid biomarker data required for this analysis. Maternal education data were available from 10 305 of these children. Primary outcome measure Haemoglobin concentration. Results We found that 70.6\% (95\% {CI}: 62.7\% to 78.5\%) of severe anaemia was attributable to malaria compared with 12.4\% (95\% {CI}: 11.1\% to 13.7\%) of mild-to-severe and 29.6\% (95\% {CI}: 29.6\% to 31.8\%) of moderate-to-severe anaemia and that {SCD} contributed 0.6\% (95\% {CI}: 0.4\% to 0.9\%), 1.3\% (95\% {CI}: 1.0\% to 1.7\%) and 10.6\% (95\% {CI}: 6.7\% to 14.9\%) mild-to-severe, moderate-to-severe and severe anaemia, respectively. Sickle trait was protective against anaemia and was associated with higher haemoglobin concentration compared with children with normal haemoglobin ({HbAA}) among malaria-positive but not malaria-negative children. Conclusions This approach used offers a new tool to estimate the contribution of malaria to anaemia in many settings using widely available {DHS} data. The fraction of anaemia among young children in Nigeria attributable to malaria and {SCD} is higher at more severe levels of anaemia. Prevention of malaria and {SCD} and timely treatment of affected individuals would reduce cases of severe anaemia.  ©},

	abstract = {Background: Expanding health insurance coverage is a priority under Sustainable Development Goal 3. To address the intersection between poverty and health and remove cost barriers, the government of Ghana established the National Health Insurance Scheme ({NHIS}). Government further linked {NHIS} with the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty ({LEAP}) 1000 cash transfer program by waiving premium fees for {LEAP} 1000 households. This linkage led to increased {NHIS} enrolment, however, large enrolment gaps remained. One potential reason for failure to enroll may relate to the poor quality of health services. Methods: We examine whether {LEAP} 1000 impacts on {NHIS} enrolment were moderated by health facilities’ service availability and readiness. Results: We find that adults in areas with the highest service availability and readiness are 18 percentage points more likely to enroll in {NHIS} because of {LEAP} 1000, compared to program effects of only 9 percentage points in low service availability and readiness areas. Similar differences were seen for enrolment among children (20 v. 0 percentage points) and women of reproductive age (25 v. 10 percentage points). Conclusions: We find compelling evidence that supply-side factors relating to service readiness and availability boost positive impacts of a cash transfer program on {NHIS} enrolment. Our work suggests that demand-side interventions coupled with supply-side strengthening may facilitate greater population-level benefits down the line. In the quest for expanding financial protection towards accelerating the achievement of universal health coverage, policymakers in Ghana should prioritize the integration of efforts to simultaneously address demand- and supply-side factors.

However, oftentimes evidence is lacking on progress towards quality patient-centred care and out-of-pocket expenditure ({OOPE}), particularly for poor population groups. We contribute patient-centred evidence examining patient experience and {OOPE} under {JKN}, the Indonesian social health insurance. Methods: Using data from 2526 patient exit interviews conducted among {JKN} beneficiaries in 2015, we computed a summative patient experience measure from 14 experience items. We used descriptive statistics to assess patient experience and the probability, amount and components of {OOPE}. We applied a two-part model to examine the relationships between socio-demographics, facility types, and {OOPE} and an {OLS} regression on patient experience determinants. Results: The mean patient experience measure was 11.7 out of 14 maximal points. Differences were observed between single items, with highest ratings on ease of understanding providers' language (97\%) and lowest on waiting time (54\%). {OOPE} were reported by 20\% of patients with a mean equivalent to {US}\$40, the most prevalent reason being medicines (61\% of all {OOPE}). Considerable {OOPE} heterogeneity occurred by province and facility type. We found differentials in {OOPE} by gender (females paying more likely, but less) and subsidised {JKN} membership (same likelihood as non-subsidised, but paying less). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that during its early implementation, patients under {JKN} reported mostly positive patient experience yet a fifth incurred {OOPE}, mostly on medicines. Further patient-centred research is needed to ensure {JKN}'s progress towards {UHC}. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: Primary health care is a critical foundation of high-quality health systems. Health facility management has been studied in high-income countries, but there are significant measurement gaps about facility management and primary health care performance in low and middle-income countries. A primary health care facility management evaluation tool ({PRIME}-Tool) was initially piloted in Ghana where better facility management was associated with higher performance on select primary health care outcomes such as essential drug availability, trust in providers, ease of following a provider’s advice, and overall patient-reported quality rating. In this study, we sought to understand health facility management within Uganda's decentralized primary health care system. Methods: We administered and analyzed a cross-sectional household and health facility survey conducted in Uganda in 2019, assessing facility management using the {PRIME}-Tool. Results: Better facility management was associated with better essential drug availability but not better performance on measures of stocking equipment. Facilities with better {PRIME}-Tool management scores trended towards better performance on a number of experiential quality measures. We found significant disparities in the management performance of primary health care facilities. In particular, patients with greater wealth and education and those living in urban areas sought care at facilities that performed better on management. Private facilities and hospitals performed better on the management index than public facilities and health centers and clinics. Conclusions: These results suggest that investments in stronger facility management in Uganda may strengthen key aspects of facility readiness such as essential drug availability and potentially could affect experiential quality of care. Nevertheless, the stark disparities demonstrate that Uganda policymakers need to target investments strategically in order to improve primary health care equitably across socioeconomic status and geography. Moreover, other low and middle-income countries may benefit from the use of the {PRIME}-Tool to rapidly assess facility management with the goal of understanding and improving primary health care performance. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction: Postnatal care ({PNC}) is an underused service in the continuum of care for mothers and infants in sub-Saharan Africa. There is little evidence on health facility characteristics that influence {PNC} utilization. Understanding {PNC} use in the context of individual, community, and health facility characteristics may help in the development of programs for increased use. Methods: We analyzed data from 4,353 women with recent births in Kigoma Region, Tanzania, and their use of {PNC} (defined as at least 1 checkup in a health facility in the region within 42 days of delivery). We used a mixed-effects multilevel logistic regression analysis to explain {PNC} use while accounting for household, individual, and community characteristics from a regionwide population-based reproductive health survey and for distance to and adequacy of proximal health facilities from a health facility assessment. Results: {PNC} utilization rate was low (15.9\%). Women had significantly greater odds of {PNC} if they had a high level of decision-making autonomy (adjusted odds ratio [{aOR}]: 1.56; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]=1.11, 2.17); had a companion at birth ({aOR}: 1.57; 95\% {CI}¼1.19, 2.07); had cesarean delivery ({aOR}: 2.27; 95\% {CI}¼1.47, 3.48); resided in Kasulu district ({aOR}: 3.28; 95\% {CI}¼1.94, 5.52); or resided in a community that had at least 1 adequate health facility within 5 km ({aOR}: 2.15; 95\% {CI}¼1.06, 3.88). Conclusion: Women’s decision-making autonomy and presence of companionship at birth, as well as proximity to a health facility with adequate infrastructure, equipment, and workforce, were associated with increased {PNC} use. More efforts toward advocating for the health benefits of {PNC} using multiple channels and increasing quality of care in health facilities, including companionship at birth, can increase utilization rates. © 2023 Johns Hopkins University Press.

	abstract = {Border malaria is frequently cited as an obstacle to malaria elimination and sometimes used as a justification for the failure of elimination. Numerous border or cross-border meetings and elimination initiatives have been convened to address this bottleneck to elimination. In this Perspective, border malaria is defined as malaria transmission, or the potential for transmission, across or along shared land borders between countries where at least one of them has ongoing malaria transmission. Border malaria is distinct from malaria importation, which can occur anywhere and in any country. The authors’ analysis shows that the remaining transmission foci of malaria-eliminating countries tend to occur in the vicinity of international land borders that they share with neighbouring endemic countries. The reasons why international land borders often represent the last mile in malaria elimination are complex. The authors argue that the often higher intrinsic transmission potential, the neglect of investment and development, the constant risk of malaria importation due to cross-border movement, the challenges of implementing interventions in complex environments and uncoordinated action in a cross-border shared transmission focus all contribute to the difficulties of malaria elimination in border areas. Border malaria reflects the limitations of the current tools and interventions for malaria elimination and implies the need for social cohesion, basic health services, community economic conditions, and policy dialogue and coordination to achieve the expected impact of malaria interventions. Given the uniqueness of each border and the complex and multifaceted nature of border malaria, a situation analysis to define and characterize the determinants of transmission is essential to inform a problem-solving mindset and develop appropriate strategies to eliminate malaria in these areas. © 2023, {BioMed} Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Papua New Guinea ({PNG}) has one of the highest burdens of {HIV} and syphilis in pregnancy in the Asia-Pacific region. Timely and effective diagnosis can alleviate the burden of {HIV} and syphilis and improve maternal and newborn health. Supply-side factors related to implementation and scale up remain problematic, yet few studies have considered their impact on antenatal testing and treatment for {HIV} and syphilis. This study explores health service availability and readiness for antenatal {HIV} and/or syphilis testing and treatment in {PNG}. Methods: Using data from two sources, we demonstrate health service availability and readiness. Service availability is measured at a province level as the average of three indicators: infrastructure, workforce, and antenatal clinic utilization. The readiness score comprises 28 equally weighted indicators across four domains; and is estimated for 73 health facilities. Bivariate and multivariate robust linear regressions explore associations between health facility readiness and the proportion of antenatal clinic attendees tested and treated for {HIV} and/or syphilis. Results: Most provinces had fewer than one health facility per 10 000 population. On average, health worker density was 11 health workers per 10 000 population per province, and approximately 22\% of pregnant women attended four or more antenatal clinics. Most health facilities had a composite readiness score between 51\% and 75\%, with urban health facilities faring better than rural ones. The multivariate regression analysis, when controlling for managing authority, catchment population, the number of clinicians employed, health facility type and residence (urban/rural) indicated a weak positive relationship between health facility readiness and the proportion of antenatal clinic attendees tested and treated for {HIV} and/or syphilis. Conclusion: This study adds to the limited evidence base for the Asia-Pacific region. There is a need to improve antenatal testing and treatment coverage for {HIV} and syphilis and reduce healthcare inequalities faced by rural and urban communities. Shortages of skilled health workers, tests, and medicines impede the provision of quality antenatal care. Improving service availability and health facility readiness are key to ensuring the effective provision of antenatal care interventions. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Underlying this challenge is a lack of coherent approaches to measure the extent of integration and how this influences desired outcomes. The aim of this scoping review is to identify measurement approaches for integration in {LMICs} and map them for future use. Methods: Arksey and O’Malley’s framework for scoping reviews was followed. We conducted a systematic search of peer-reviewed literature measuring integration in {LMICs} across three databases and screened identified papers by predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A modified version of the Rainbow Model for Integrated Care guided charting and analysis of the data. Results: We included 99 studies. Studies were concentrated in the Africa region and most frequently focused on the integration of {HIV} care with other services. A range of definitions and methods were identified, with no single approach for the measurement of integration dominating the literature. Measurement of clinical integration was the most common, with indicators focused on measuring receipt of two or more services provided at a single point of time. Organizational and professional integration indicators were focused on inter- and intra-organizational communication, collaboration, coordination, and continuity of care, while functional integration measured common information systems or patient records. Gaps were identified in measuring systems and normative integration. Few tools were validated or publicly available for future use. Conclusion: We identified a wide range of recent approaches used to measure integration in {LMICs}. Our findings underscore continued challenges with lack of conceptual cohesion and fragmentation which limits how integration is understood in practice. © 2023, {BioMed} Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Urbanization generally improves health outcomes of residents and is one of the potential factors that might contribute to reducing malaria transmission. However, the expansion of Anopheles stephensi, an urban malaria vector, poses a threat for malaria control and elimination efforts in Africa. In this paper, malaria trends in urban settings in Ethiopia from 2014 to 2019 are reported with a focus on towns and cities where An. stephensi surveys were conducted. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted to determine malaria trends in urban districts using passive surveillance data collected at health facilities from 2014 to 2019. Data from 25 towns surveyed for An. stephensi were used in malaria trend analysis. Robust linear models were used to identify outliers and impute missing and anomalous data. The seasonal Mann-Kendal test was used to test for monotonic increasing or decreasing trends. Results: A total of 9,468,970 malaria cases were reported between 2014 and 2019 through the Public Health Emergency Management ({PHEM}) system. Of these, 1.45 million (15.3\%) cases were reported from urban settings. The incidence of malaria declined by 62\% between 2014 and 2018. In 2019, the incidence increased to 15 per 1000 population from 11 to 1000 in 2018. Both confirmed (microscopy or {RDT}) Plasmodium falciparum (67\%) and Plasmodium vivax (28\%) were reported with a higher proportion of P. vivax infections in urban areas. In 2019, An. stephensi was detected in 17 towns where more than 19,804 malaria cases were reported, with most of the cases (56\%) being P. falciparum. Trend analysis revealed that malaria cases increased in five towns in Afar and Somali administrative regions, decreased in nine towns, and had no obvious trend in the remaining three towns. Conclusion: The contribution of malaria in urban settings is not negligible in Ethiopia. With the rapid expansion of An. stephensi in the country, the receptivity is likely to be higher for malaria. Although the evidence presented in this study does not demonstrate a direct linkage between An. stephensi detection and an increase in urban malaria throughout the country, An. stephensi might contribute to an increase in malaria unless control measures are implemented as soon as possible. Targeted surveillance and effective response are needed to assess the contribution of this vector to malaria transmission and curb potential outbreaks. © 2023, {BioMed} Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: In Ethiopia only 53\% of induced abortions were performed in a health facility. Even though efforts have been made to improve comprehensive abortion care ({CAC}), still several health facilities fail to provide the services. Even in facilities where such care is provided, significant numbers of clients report their dissatisfaction with the service. Hence, this study sought to assess availability and readiness to meet the need for {CAC}, client satisfaction with the service and associated factors in public health facilities of East Shawa Zone, from March 1 to July 31, 2020. Method: Cross-sectional study was conducted taking a random sample of 30 health facilities and 900 women who received {CAC} and providers who delivered the services. Data were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire and observational checklist. The analysis was performed using Stata-13. Descriptive summaries were used to characterize study participants, to determine service availability and readiness of facilities. The levels of satisfaction were estimated using proportion with a 95\% confidence interval ({CI}). Multilevel ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with service satisfaction. The magnitude of association was estimated by adjusted odds ratios ({AOR}) with a 95\% {CI}, and a p-value {\textless} 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. Results: The study found that all health facilities fulfilled at least three-fourth (75\%) of the requirements that ensure {CAC} services availability. However, the percentage of facilities that fulfilled at least three-fourth of equipment was 60\%; medicines, 56.7\%; and basic amenities, 46.7\%. Overall, 19.3\% of women (95\% {CI} 16.9\%, 22.0\%) reported very high level of satisfaction with {CAC} services. The levels of Satisfaction with the services were associated with being treated with second trimester abortion ({AOR}) = 2.07; 95\% {CI} 1.03, 4.15) and having good procedure outcome ({AOR} = 2.09; 95\% {CI} 1.09, 4.15), being treated by younger service provider, less than 35 year old ({AOR} = 8.58; 95\% {CI} 3.66, 20.12), by a nurse ({AOR} = 2.96; 95\% {CI} 1.49, 5.87), provider with three to five years of experience ({AOR} = 0.46; 95\% {CI} 0.23, 0.92) and with the availability of essential medicines ({AOR} = 4.34; 95\% {CI} 1.06, 18.20). Conclusions: The availability of essential medicines was below the standards set by World Health Organization. The levels of satisfaction with {CAC} is comparably lower than other studies findings and affected by the availability of essential medicines, procedure outcome, and gestational age of terminated pregnancy, the health care provider’s age, profession and years of experience. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of health facility-level factors, including the availability of long-acting modern contraceptives ({LAMC}) at the nearest health facility and its distance from women’s homes, on the occurrence of unintended pregnancy that resulted in a live birth. We analysed the 2017/18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data linked with the 2017 Bangladesh Health Facility Survey. The weighted sample comprised 5051 women of reproductive age, who had at least one live birth within 3 years of the survey. The outcome variable was women’s intention to conceive at their most recent pregnancy that ended with a live birth. The major explanatory variables were the health facility level factors. A multi-level multinomial logistic regression model was used to assess the association of the outcome variable with explanatory variables adjusting for individual, household, and community-level factors. Nearly 21\% of the total respondents reported that their most recent live birth was unintended at conception. Better health facility management systems and health facility infrastructure were found to be 14–30\% protective of unintended pregnancy that resulted in a live birth. {LAMC} availability at the nearest health facility was associated with a 31\% reduction (95\% {CI} 0.50–0.92) in the likelihood of an unwanted pregnancy that resulted in a live birth. Health facility readiness to provide {LAMC} was also associated with a 14–16\% reduction in unintended pregnancies that ended with a birth. The likelihood of unintended pregnancy that resulted in a live birth increased around 20–22\% with the increased distance of the nearest health facility providing {LAMC} from the women’s homes.The availability of health facilities near women’s homes and access to {LAMC} can significantly reduce unintended pregnancy. Policies and programs to ensure access and affordability of {LAMC} across current health facilities and to increase the number of health facilities are recommended. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: The {COVID}-19 pandemic and the associated social restrictions may have disrupted the provision of essential services, including family planning ({FP}) and contraceptive services. This protocol is adapted from a generic study protocol titled “Health systems analysis and evaluations of the barriers to availability and readiness of sexual and reproductive health services in {COVID}-19 affected areas,” conducted by the World Health Organization ({WHO}) Department of Reproductive Health and Research. Objective: This study aims to assess the availability and use of {FP} and contraceptive services in primary health facilities during and after the {COVID}-19 pandemic; assess the risk perceptions of {COVID}-19 stigma, barriers to access, and quality of services from clients’ and providers’ perspectives in the {COVID}-19–affected areas; and assess the postpandemic recovery of the facilities in the provision of {FP} and contraceptive services. Methods: In-depth interviews will be conducted with clients—women in the reproductive age group and their male partners who visit the selected health facilities for {FP} and contraceptive services—and health providers (the most knowledgeable person on {FP} and contraceptive service provision) at the selected health facilities. Focus group discussions will be conducted with clients at the selected health facilities and in the community. The in-depth interviews and focus group discussions will help to understand clients’ and health service providers’ perspectives of {FP} and contraceptive service availability and readiness in {COVID}-19–affected areas. A cross-sectional health facility assessment will be conducted in all the selected health facilities to determine the health facility infrastructure’s ability and readiness to provide {FP} and contraceptive services and to capture the trends in {FP} and contraceptive services available during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Scientific approval for this study is obtained from the {WHO} Research Project Review Panel, and the {WHO} Ethics Review Committee has given ethical approval in the 3 countries. Results: Using a standardized research protocol will ensure that the results from this study can be compared across regions and countries. The study was funded in March 2021. It received ethics approval from the {WHO} Ethics Review Committee in February 2022. We completed data collection in September 2022. We plan to complete the data analysis by March 2023. We plan to publish the study results by Summer 2023. Conclusions: The findings from this study will provide a better understanding of the impact of the {COVID}-19 pandemic on {FP} and contraceptive services at the facility level, which will help policy makers and health managers develop and strengthen {FP} policies and services in health facilities to be more responsive to community needs. ©Rita Kabra, Beena Joshi, Ester Elisaria, Tanimola Makanjuola Akande, Komal Preet Allagh, Adesola Olumide, Deepti Tandon, Ranjan Kumar Prusty, Mary Ramesh, Donat Shamba, James Kiarie.},

	abstract = {Background: Nepal has committed to achieving universal coverage of quality maternal and newborn health ({MNH}) services by 2030. Achieving this, however, requires urgently addressing the widening inequity gradient in {MNH} care utilisation. This qualitative study examined the multidomain systemic and organisational challenges, operating in multi-level health systems, that influence equitable access to {MNH} services in Nepal. Methods: Twenty-eight in-depth interviews were conducted with health policymakers and program managers to understand supply-side perspectives of drivers of inequity in {MNH} services. Braun and Clarke’s thematic approach was employed in analysing the data. Themes were generated and explained using a multidomain (structural, intermediary, and health system) and multi-level (micro, meso and macro) analytical framework. Results: Participants identified underlying factors that intersect at the micro, meso and macro levels of the health system to create inequity in {MNH} services. Key challenges identified at the macro (federal) level included corruption and poor accountability, weak digital governance and institutionalisation of policies, politicisation of the health workforce, poor regulation of private {MNH} services, weak health management, and lack of integration of health in all policies. At the meso (provincial) level, identified factors included weak decentralisation, inadequate evidence-based planning, lack of contextualizing health services for the population, and non-health sector policies. Challenges at the micro (local) level were poor quality health care, inadequate empowerment in household decision making and lack of community participation. Structural drivers operated mostly at macro-level political factors; intermediary challenges were within the non-health sector but influenced supply and demand sides of health systems. Conclusions: Multidomain systemic and organisational challenges, operating in multi-level health systems, influence the provision of equitable health services in Nepal. Policy reforms and institutional arrangements that align with the country’s federalised health system are needed to narrow the gap. Such reform efforts should include policy and strategic reforms at the federal level, contextualisation of macro-policies at the provincial level, and context-specific health service delivery at the local level. Macro-level policies should be guided by political commitment and strong accountability, including a policy framework for regulating private health services. The decentralisation of power, resources, and institutions at the provincial level is essential for technical support to the local health systems. Integrating health in all policies and implementation is critical in addressing contextual social determinants of health. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Understanding the availability of rapid diagnostic tests ({RDTs}) is essential for attaining universal health care and reducing health inequalities. Although routine data helps measure {RDT} coverage and health access gaps, many healthcare facilities fail to report their monthly diagnostic test data to routine health systems, impacting routine data quality. This study sought to understand whether non-reporting by facilities is due to a lack of diagnostic and/or service provision capacity by triangulating routine and health service assessment survey data in Kenya. Methods: Routine facility-level data on {RDT} administration were sourced from the Kenya health information system for the years 2018–2020. Data on diagnostic capacity ({RDT} availability) and service provision (screening, diagnosis, and treatment) were obtained from a national health facility assessment conducted in 2018. The two sources were linked and compared obtaining information on 10 {RDTs} from both sources. The study then assessed reporting in the routine system among facilities with (i) diagnostic capacity only, (ii) both confirmed diagnostic capacity and service provision and (iii) without diagnostic capacity. Analyses were conducted nationally, disaggregated by {RDT}, facility level and ownership. Results: Twenty-one per cent (2821) of all facilities expected to report routine diagnostic data in Kenya were included in the triangulation. Most (86\%) were primary-level facilities under public ownership (70\%). Overall, survey response rates on diagnostic capacity were high ({\textgreater} 70\%). Malaria and {HIV} had the highest response rate ({\textgreater} 96\%) and the broadest coverage in diagnostic capacity across facilities ({\textgreater} 76\%). Reporting among facilities with diagnostic capacity varied by test, with {HIV} and malaria having the lowest reporting rates, 58\% and 52\%, respectively, while the rest ranged between 69\% and 85\%. Among facilities with both service provision and diagnostic capacity, reporting ranged between 52\% and 83\% across tests. Public and secondary facilities had the highest reporting rates across all tests. A small proportion of health facilities without diagnostic capacity submitted testing reports in 2018, most of which were primary facilities. Conclusion: Non-reporting in routine health systems is not always due to a lack of capacity. Further analyses are required to inform other drivers of non-reporting to ensure reliable routine health data. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Most evidence on Performance Based Financing ({PBF}) in low-income settings has focused on services delivered by providers in targeted health administrations, with limited understanding of how effects on health and care vary within them. We evaluated the population effects of a program implemented in two provinces in Mozambique, focusing on child, maternal and {HIV}/{AIDS} care and knowledge. We used a difference-in-difference estimation strategy applied to data on mothers from the Demographic Health Surveys, linked to information on their closest health facility. The impact of {PBF} was limited. {HIV} testing during antenatal care increased, particularly for women who were wealthier, more educated, or residing in Gaza Province. Knowledge about transmission of {HIV} from mother-to-child, and its prevention, increased, particularly for women who were less wealthy, less educated, or residing in Nampula Province. Exploiting the roll-out by facility, we found that the effects were concentrated on less wealthy and less educated women, whose closest facility was in the referral network of a {PBF} facility. Results suggest that {HIV} testing and knowledge promotion increased in the whole district, as a strategy to boost referral for highly incentivized {HIV} services delivered in {PBF} facilities. However, demand-side constraints may prevent the use of those services. © 2023 The Authors. Health Economics published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

The groups suffering the most are the populations in Empowered Action Group ({EAG}) states, with limited access to health interventions and higher mortality and morbidity rates. Madhya Pradesh, an {EAG} state, is infamous for its low-level health status due to disparities in access to health care. This study aimed to understand how access to health care differs spatially in the state and identify the hotspots for urgent attention. Indicators related to health were selected from the association of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing) with other {SDGs}, especially from 1 to 10. Principal Component Analysis was used to construct two indices, viz. Health Status Index ({HSI}) and Health Intervention Index ({HII}) out of the indicators. The results showed that the spatial distribution of {HSI} and {HII} possess a positive Moran’s I, indicating spatial clustering of these indices in the state. The bivariate association between the two indices is positive but close to zero, indicating a lower association between coverage of health indicators and health status among districts of Madhya Pradesh. These results can provide wide applications while targeting health interventions at the district level. © 2023, The Japan Section of the Regional Science Association International.},

	abstract = {Background: Poor quality of care is a barrier to engagement in {HIV} care and treatment in low- and middle-income country settings. This study involved focus group discussions ({FGD}) with patients and health workers in two large urban hospitals to describe quality of patient education and psychosocial support services within Haiti’s national {HIV} antiretroviral therapy ({ART}) program. The purpose of this qualitative study was to illuminate key gaps and salient “ingredients” for improving quality of care. Methods: The study included 8 {FGDs} with a total of 26 male patients and 32 female patients and 15 smaller {FGDs} with 57 health workers. The analysis used a directed content analysis method, with the goal of extending existing conceptual frameworks on quality of care through rich description. Results: Dimension of safety, patient-centeredness, accessibility, and equity were most salient. Patients noted risks to privacy with both clinic and community-based services as well as concerns with {ART} side effects, while health workers described risks to their own safety in providing community-based services. While patients cited examples of positive interactions with health workers that centered their needs and perspectives, they also noted concerns that inhibited trust and satisfaction with services. Health workers described difficult working conditions that challenged their ability to provide patient-centered services. Patients sought favored relationships with health workers to help them navigate the health care system, but this undermined the sense of fairness. Both patients and health workers described frustration with lack of resources to assist patients in dire poverty, and health workers described great pressure to help patients from their “own pockets.” Conclusions: These concerns reflected the embeddedness of patient – provider interactions within a health system marked by scarcity, power dynamics between patients and health workers, and social stigma related to {HIV}. Reinforcing a respectful and welcoming atmosphere, timely service, privacy protection, and building patient perception of fairness in access to support could help to build patient satisfaction and care engagement in Haiti. Improving working conditions for health workers is also critical to achieving quality. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: About 75.5\% of women in Nepal’s urban areas receive at least four {ANC} visits, compared to 61.7\% of women in the country’s rural areas. Similarly, just 34\% of women in the lowest wealth quintile give birth in a medical facility compared to 90\% of women in the richest group. As a result of this inequality, the poor in emerging nations suffer since those who are better off can make greater use of the healthcare than those who are less fortunate. This study aims to examine and decompose the contributions of various socioeconomic factors towards {MCH} service inequality in Nepal in the years 2011 and 2016. Methods: Inequality in {MCH} services was estimated using concentration curves and their corresponding indices using data from Nepal Demographic Health Survey ({NDHS}) 2011 and 2016. We examined the inequality across three {MCH} service outcomes: less than 4 {ANC} visits, no postnatal checkups within 2 months of delivery and no {SBA} delivery and decomposed them across observed characteristics of the mothers aged between 15 and 49. Furthermore, Oaxaca-blinder decomposition approach was used to measure and decompose the inequality differential between two time periods. Results: Inequality in {MCH} services was prevalent for all 3 {MCH} outcomes in 2011 and 2016, respectively. However, the concentration indices for {\textless}4 {ANC} visits, no {SBA} delivery, and no postnatal checkups within 2 months of birth increased from -0.2184, -0.1643, and -0.1284 to -0.1871, -0.0504, and -0.0218 correspondingly, showing the decrease in {MCH} services inequality over two time periods. Wealth index, women’s literacy, place of living, mother’s employment status, and problem of distance to reach nearest health facility were the main contributors. Conclusion: We find that {MCH} services are clearly biased towards the women with higher living standards. National policies should focus on empowering women through education and employment, along with the creation of health facilities and improved educational institutions, in order to address inequalities in living standards, women’s education levels, and the problem of distance. Leveraging these factors can reduce inequality in {MCH} services. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background Facility readiness is an important prerequisite for providing safe, effective childbirth care. This study assesses the readiness of health facilities in Ethiopia to provide childbirth services, describes variations in geographic access to service-ready facilities, and evaluates how facility readiness relates to childbirth service usage with a lens on equity. Methods The study used cross-sectional data from a nationally representative sample of households in Ethiopia linked with data from health facilities serving the same areas. We explored variation in childbirth service readiness across facilities and classified facilities as “service-ready” if they had a readiness score of 0.75 or higher on a 0-1 scale. We used logistic regression modeling to examine the odds of residing within 10 kilometers of a service-ready facility by socioeconomic and geographic characteristics, and the odds of a facility delivery given the readiness of nearby facilities. Results Childbirth service readiness was generally high for hospitals (median score: 0.92) with minimal variation (interquartile range, {IQR}: 0.88 to 0.96). Health centers and clinics displayed lower and more variable readiness (median: 0.75, {IQR}: 0.66 to 0.84). In both crude and adjusted regression analyses, odds of residing within 10 kilometers of a service-ready facility were significantly greater for women with higher education levels, greater wealth, and urban residence. We found the adjusted odds of using facility childbirth services were 1.23 (95\% {CI}: 1.03, 1.48) times greater for each 0.10-unit increase in the readiness level of nearby facilities. Conclusions Access to childbirth care is not equal for Ethiopian women. Those living in rural areas and the poor must travel farther to reach facility childbirth services, and the nearest facilities serving these women were less prepared to provide quality care. This may contribute to lower service utilization by such disadvantaged groups of women. © 2023, Journal of Global Health Reports. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The use of contraceptive is key in reducing unsafe abortion from unintended pregnancies, infant mortality, adolescent pregnancies, slowing population growth and helps to prevent {HIV}/{AIDS}. However, less than one-third of women within reproductive age in Ethiopia uses modern contraceptive methods. Hence, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of modern contraceptive utilization and to identify potential factors on use of modern contraceptive method. Methods: Data from 2019 Ethiopian Mini Demographic and Health Survey were used in this analysis. A total of 8885 women within the ages of 15–49 years across 305 enumeration areas in nine regions and two city administrations were included in the analysis. Multivariable logistic regression model were applied to examine the association between women’s background characteristics and modern contraceptives utilization. Results: Only 28.1\% of all women used modern contraceptives. About 40\% of the modern contraceptive users were between age of 25–29 and 30–34 years. There was significant association between women’s age, level of education, region, religion, parity, wealth quintile and marital status on use of modern contraceptives. Women who were married and living with partners were about 20 ({AOR} = 19.91, 95\% {CI}: 14.27, 27.78) and 24 ({AOR} = 23.51, 95\% {CI}: 14.66, 37.72) times more likely to use modern contraceptives compared to sexually active unmarried women. Conclusion: The study showed that the use of modern contraceptive method is not adequate and it is also influenced by socio-demographic and economic characteristics of women in Ethiopia. Therefore, increasing the awareness of women to use modern contraceptive methods is vital. We suggest that there is a need to improve the service in women age above 39 years, women in Afar, Somali, Harari and Diredawa regions; and protestant, Muslim and traditional religion followers. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Antenatal care coverage has dramatically increased in many low-and middle-income settings, including in the state of Telangana, India. However, there is increasing evidence of shortfalls in the quality of care women receive during their pregnancies. This study aims to examine dimensions of antenatal care quality in Telangana, India using four primary and secondary data sources. Methods: Data from two secondary statewide data sources (National Family Health Survey ({NFHS}-5), 2019–21; Health Management Information System ({HMIS}), 2019–20) and two primary data sources (a facility survey in 19 primary health centres and sub-centres in selected districts of Telangana; and observations of 36 antenatal care consultations at these facilities) were descriptively analysed. Results: {NFHS}-5 data showed about 73\% of women in Telangana received all six assessed antenatal care components during pregnancy. {HMIS} data showed high coverage of antenatal care visits but differences in levels of screening, with high coverage of haemoglobin tests for anaemia but low coverage of testing for gestational diabetes and syphilis. The facility survey found missing equipment for several key antenatal care services. Antenatal care observations found blood pressure measurement and physical examinations had high coverage and were generally performed correctly. There were substantial deficiencies in symptom checking and communication between the woman and provider. Women were asked if they had any questions in 22\% of consultations. Only one woman was asked about her mental health. Counselling of women on at least one of the ten items relating to birth preparedness and on at least one of six danger signs occurred in 58\% and 36\% of consultations, respectively. Conclusion: Despite high coverage of antenatal care services and some essential maternal and foetal assessments, substantial quality gaps remained, particularly in communication between healthcare providers and pregnant women and in availability of key services. Progress towards achieving high quality in both content and experience of antenatal care requires addressing service gaps and developing better measures to capture and improve women’s experiences of care. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: In rural Nepal, where women face financial and geographic barriers in accessing ultrasound scans, the government initiated a Rural Obstetric Ultrasound Program ({ROUSG}) to train skilled birth attendants ({SBAs}) in rural birthing centers and expand access to routine ultrasound scans for local pregnant women. This study explores the perceived benefits and limitations of the training and implementation of this program. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted in 15 primary care facilities in Bhojpur and Dhading, two rural districts of Nepal. The research team conducted in-depth interviews with 15 trained {SBAs} and focus group discussions with 48 service recipients and 30 {FCHVs} to gain insight into their perceptions. All interviews and focus group discussions were recorded, reviewed, and manually coded into {MS} Excel. Results: Overall, our findings indicated that the {ROUSG} program was very well received among all our study participants, though critical gaps were identified, mostly during the training of the {SBAs}. These included insufficient guidance or practice opportunities during training and the challenges of implementing the mobile obstetric ultrasound service. Most importantly, though, our results suggest that the implementation of the {ROUSG} program increased access to prenatal care, earlier identification and referrals for abnormal scans, as well as reduced pregnancy-related stress. There was also a notable anecdotal increase in antenatal care utilization and institutional deliveries, as well as high satisfaction in both service providers and recipients. Conclusion: Our findings highlighted that while the training component could use some strengthening with increased opportunities for supervised practice sessions and periodic refresher training after the initial 21-days, the program itself had the potential to fill crucial gaps in maternal and newborn care in rural Nepal, by expanding access not only to {ROUSG} services but also to other {MNH} services such as {ANC} and institutional deliveries. Our findings also support the use of ultrasound in areas with limited resources as a solution to identify potential complications at earlier stages of pregnancy and improve timely referrals, indicating the potential for reducing maternal and neonatal morbidities. This initial study supports further research into the role {ROUSG} can play in expanding critical {MNH} services in underserved areas and improving broader health outcomes through earlier identification of potential obstetric complications. © 2023, {BioMed} Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Healthcare workers’ ({HCWs}) knowledge of multi-stranded cholera interventions (including case management, water, sanitation, and hygiene ({WASH}), surveillance/laboratory methods, coordination, and vaccination) is crucial to the implementation of these interventions in healthcare facilities, especially in conflict-affected settings where cholera burden is particularly high. We aimed to assess Nigerian {HCWs}’ knowledge of cholera interventions and identify the associated factors. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire with {HCWs} from 120 healthcare facilities in Adamawa and Bauchi States, North-East Nigeria. A knowledge score was created by assigning a point for each correct response. {HCWs}’ knowledge of cholera interventions, calculated as a score, was recoded for ease of interpretation as follows: 0–50 (low); 51–70 (moderate); ≥ 71 (high). Additionally, we defined the inadequacy of {HCWs}’ knowledge of cholera interventions based on a policy-relevant threshold of equal or lesser than 75 scores for an intervention. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with the adequacy of knowledge score. Results: Overall, 490 {HCWs} participated in the study (254 in Adamawa and 236 in Bauchi), with a mean age of 35.5 years. {HCWs}’ knowledge score was high for surveillance/laboratory methods, moderate for case management, {WASH}, and vaccination, and low for coordination. {HCWs}’ knowledge of coordination improved with higher cadre, working in urban- or peri-urban-based healthcare facilities, and secondary education; cholera case management and vaccination knowledge improved with post-secondary education, working in Bauchi State and urban areas, previous training in cholera case management and response to a cholera outbreak—working in peri-urban areas had a negative effect. {HCWs}’ knowledge of surveillance/laboratory methods improved with a higher cadre, 1-year duration in current position, secondary or post-secondary education, previous training in cholera case management and response to a cholera outbreak. However, {HCWs}’ current position had both positive and negative impacts on their {WASH} knowledge. Conclusions: {HCWs} in both study locations recorded a considerable knowledge of multi-stranded cholera interventions. While {HCWs}’ demographic characteristics appeared irrelevant in determining their knowledge of cholera interventions, geographic location and experiences from the current position, training and involvement in cholera outbreak response played a significant role. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Effective delivery of health services requires adequate quality in healthcare facilities and easy accessibility to health services physically or virtually. The purpose of this study was to reveal how the quality of healthcare facilities varies across the different parts of Ho Chi Minh City and how well residents (N = 9 million) can reach healthcare facilities. By demarcating the deficiently served areas of low accessibility, the study shows where urban planning and digital healthcare could improve accessibility to health services and the quality of services efficiently. Methods: The analysis utilised geocoded information on hospitals, clinics, roads and population and the data of the quality scores of healthcare facilities. Quality scores were analysed by hot spot analysis and inverse distance weighting. Accessibility and formation of travel time-based service areas by travel time distances were calculated using road network, driving speed and population data. Results: The results unveiled a centripetal spatial pattern of healthcare facilities and a similar pattern in their quality. Outside the travel time of 30 min for hospitals and 15 min for clinics, the deficiently served areas have a population of 1.1 to 1.2 million. Based on the results and the evidence of digital healthcare, this paper highlights how to develop and plan spatially effective service provision. Especially, it gives grounds to discuss how cost-effective digital healthcare could be applied to improve the accessibility and quality of health services in an urban structure of extensively varying accessibility to health services. Conclusions: The results bring up the need and the means for improving the quality of health services and their cost-efficient availability by location optimisation, road improvements and implementing digital healthcare provided by hospitals and clinics in the city. At the same, this study provides a multidisciplinary approach for planning more equal and efficient health service provision geographically. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Routine health facility data provides the opportunity to monitor progress in quality and uptake of health care continuously. Our study aimed to assess the reliability and usefulness of emergency obstetric care data including temporal and regional variations over the past five years in Tanzania Mainland. Methods: Data were compiled from the routine monthly district reports compiled as part of the health management information systems for 2016–2020. Key indicators for maternal and neonatal care coverage, emergency obstetric and neonatal complications, and interventions indicators were computed. Assessment on reliability and consistency of reports was conducted and compared with annual rates and proportions over time, across the 26 regions in of Tanzania Mainland and by institutional delivery coverage. Results: Facility reporting was near complete with 98\% in 2018–2020. Estimated population coverage of institutional births increased by 10\% points from 71.2\% to 2016 to 81.7\% in 2020 in Tanzania Mainland, driven by increased use of dispensaries and health centres compared to hospitals. This trend was more pronounced in regions with lower institutional birth rates. The Caesarean section rate remained stable at around 10\% of institutional births. Trends in the occurrence of complications such as antepartum haemorrhage, premature rupture of membranes, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia or post-partum bleeding were consistent over time but at low levels (1\% of institutional births). Prophylactic uterotonics were provided to nearly all births while curative uterotonics were reported to be used in less than 10\% of post-partum bleeding and retained placenta cases. Conclusion: Our results show a mixed picture in terms of usefulness of the District Health Information System({DHIS}2) data. Key indicators of institutional delivery and Caesarean section rates were plausible and provide useful information on regional disparities and trends. However, obstetric complications and several interventions were underreported thus diminishing the usefulness of these data for monitoring. Further research is needed on why complications and interventions to address them are not documented reliably. © 2023, {BioMed} Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Limited information is available about the approaches used and lessons learned from low- and middle-income countries that have implemented inpatient services for small and sick newborns. We developed descriptive case studies to compare the journeys to establish inpatient newborn care across Ethiopia, India, Malawi, and Rwanda. Methods: A total of 57 interviews with stakeholders in Ethiopia (n=12), India (n=12), Malawi (n=16), and Rwanda (n=17) informed the case studies. Our heuristic data analysis followed a deductive organizing framework approach. We informed our data analysis via targeted literature searches to uncover details related to key events. We used the {NEST}360 Theory of Change for facility-based care, which reflects the World Health Organization ({WHO}) Health Systems Framework as a starting point and added, as necessary, in an edit processing format until data saturation was achieved. Findings: Results highlight the strategies and innovation used to establish small and sick newborn care by health system building block and by country. We conducted a gap analysis of implementation of {WHO} Standards for Improving Facility-Based Care. The journeys to establish inpatient newborn care across the 4 countries are similar in terms of trajectory yet unique in their implementation. Unifying themes include leadership and governance at national level to consolidate and coordinate action to improve newborn quality of care, investment to build staff skills on data collection and use, and institutionalization of regular neonatal data reviews to identify gaps and propose relevant strategies. Conclusion: Efforts to establish and scale inpatient care for small and sick newborns in Ethiopia, India, Malawi, and Rwanda over the last decade have led to remarkable success. These country examples can inspire more nascent initiatives that other low- and middle-income countries may undertake.

	abstract = {Background: Access to routine antenatal and perinatal services is improved in the last two decades in Nepal. However, gaps remain in coverage and quality of care delivered from the health facilities. This study investigated the delivery of technical quality antenatal and perinatal services from health facilities and their associated determinants in Nepal. Methods: Data for this study were derived from the Nepal Health Facility Survey 2015. The World Health Organization's Service Availability and Readiness Assessment framework was adopted to assess the technical quality of antenatal and perinatal services of health facilities. Outcome variables included technical quality scores of i) 269 facilities providing antenatal services and ii) 109 facilities providing childbirth and postnatal care services (perinatal care). Technical quality scores of health facilities were estimated adapting recommended antenatal and perinatal interventions. Independent variables included locations and types of health facilities and their management functions (e.g., supervision). We conducted a linear regression analysis to identify the determinants of better technical quality of health services in health facilities. Beta coefficients were exponentiated into odds ratios ({ORs}) and reported with 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}). The significance level was set at p-value {\textless} 0.05. Results: The mean score of the technical quality of health facilities for each outcome variable (antenatal and perinatal services) was 0.55 (out of 1.00). Compared to province one, facilities of Madhesh province had 4\% lower odds (adjusted {OR} = 0.96; 95\%{CI}: 0.92, 0.99) of providing better quality antenatal services, while health facilities of Gandaki province had higher odds of providing better quality antenatal services ({aOR} = 1.05; 95\% {CI}: 1.01, 1.10). Private facilities had higher odds ({aOR} = 1.13; 95\% {CI}: 1.03, 1.23) of providing better quality perinatal services compared to public facilities. Conclusions: Private facilities provide better quality antenatal and perinatal health services than public facilities, while health facilities of Madhesh province provide poor quality perinatal services. Health system needs to implement tailored strategies, including recruiting health workers, supervision and onsite coaching and access to necessary equipment and medicine in the facilities of Madhesh province. Health system inputs (trained human resources, equipment and supplies) are needed in the public facilities. Extending the safe delivery incentive programme to the privately managed facilities could also improve access to better quality health services in Nepal. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective Strengthening primary health centre ({PHC}) systems is a potentially effective strategy to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases in Nigeria, a low/middle-income country with limited resources. The aim of this study was to assess hypertension service availability in some {PHCs} in Nigeria and seek recommendations that could facilitate improved services from {PHC} workers. Design Explanatory sequential mixed-methods study. Settings {PHCs} in the six geopolitical zones and Federal Capital City of Nigeria. Participants Eighteen {PHC} workers and 305 {PHC} facilities. Method Hypertension service availability and readiness were assessed in {PHCs} across Nigeria using a pro forma adapted from the {WHO} Service Readiness and Assessment tool. Eighteen workers in the {PHCs} were subsequently interviewed for in-depth exploration of hypertension service availability and readiness. Findings Among the 305 health facilities assessed, 96 (31.5\%) were in urban, 94 (30.8\%) in semiurban and 115 (37.7\%) in rural local government areas. Majority of the health facilities (43.0\%) were manned by community extension workers. Only 1.6\% and 19.7\% of the health facilities had physicians and pharmacy technicians, respectively. About 22.3\% of the providers had training in hypertension in the last 1 year. All the {PHCs} lacked adequate supply of essential antihypertensive medications. The identified deficiencies were less common in the urban {PHCs} compared with others. Qualitative analysis showed that the personnel, essential facilities and medicines required to provide hypertension services in the {PHCs} were inadequate. Suggested recommendations to successfully provide these services were provision of performance-based incentives; adequate staffing and training; supportive supervision of staff; provision of adequate equipment and essential medicines for hypertension management; provision of conducive environment for clients; and community engagement and participation. Conclusion Majority of the {PHCs} are currently not adequately equipped to provide hypertension services. Addressing identified gaps and using suggestions provided will guarantee successful provision of effective services.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under {CC} {BY}-{NC}.

	abstract = {Background Among the main activities of dengue and vector control recommended by the Ministry of Health of Brazil is the inspection and monitoring of properties identified as Strategic Points ({SPs}) and Special Buildings ({SBs}). {SPs} are properties associated to hazard, where there is a concentration of suitable egg-laying containers for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, while {SBs} have greater importance for human exposure to the dengue virus. Objectives To investigate the effect of characteristics of the urban landscape on dengue incidence. Specifically, we tested if {SPs} and {SBs} affect dengue case distribution in Campinas, and if they do, if they affect the risk differently. We considered the period from 2013 to 2016. Methods We tested whether dengue cases were more numerous than expected in the vicinity of {SPs} and {SBs}, putative sources of risk, using the Negative Binomial models. We also tested the existence of a gradient in incidence with increasing distance to {SPs} and {SBs} by using Stone’s test. Results The Rate Ratios ({RR}) values were always higher closer to the {SPs} and {SBs}, and these values tended to decrease as distance from these sources increased. In general, {RR} values greater than one, which indicates a higher risk, were associated to the closest buffers from the {SPs}/{SBs} properties, until nearly 550 meters for the {SPs} and 650 meters for the {SBs}. Stone’s test results indicated that for all years considered, there was a correlation between the distance from the {SPs}/{SBs} and dengue cases occurrences, except for {SBs} from 2016. For {SPs} the relationship is stronger than for {SBs}. Discussion Results are coherent with other studies which found that these properties contribute to an increased risk of dengue transmission. We emphasize the importance of public agents’ survey work and the importance to keep and improve the inspections in {SPs}/{SBs} recorded in Campinas. © 2023 Mendes, Vanwambeke.},

	abstract = {Background: In 2008, Somalia introduced an electronic based Early Warning Alert and Response Network ({EWARN}) for real time detection and response to alerts of epidemic prone diseases in a country experiencing a complex humanitarian situation. {EWARN} was deactivated between 2008 to 2016 due to civil conflict and reactivated in 2017 during severe drought during a cholera outbreak. We present an assessment of the performance of the {EWARN} in Somalia from January 2017 to December 2020, reflections on the successes and failures, and provide future perspectives for enhancement of the {EWARN} to effectively support an Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response strategy. Methods: We described geographical coverage of the {EWARN}, system attributes, which included; sensitivity, flexibility, timeliness, data quality (measured by completeness), and positive predictive value ({PPV}). We tested for trends of timeliness of submission of epidemiological reports across the years using the Cochran-Mantel–Haenszel stratified test of association. Results: By December 2020, all 6 states and the Banadir Administrative Region were implementing {EWARN}. In 2017, only 24.6\% of the records were submitted on time, but by 2020, 96.8\% of the reports were timely (p {\textless} 0.001). Completeness averaged {\textless} 60\% in all the 4 years, with the worst-performing year being 2017. Overall, {PPV} was 14.1\%. Over time, {PPV} improved from 7.1\% in 2017 to 15.4\% in 2019 but declined to 9.7\% in 2020. Alert verification improved from 2.0\% in 2017 to 52.6\% by 2020, (p {\textless} 0.001). In 2020, {EWARN} was enhanced to facilitate {COVID}-19 reporting demonstrating its flexibility to accommodate the integration of reportable diseases. Conclusions: During the past 4 years of implementing {EWARN} in Somalia, the system has improved significantly in timeliness, disease alerts verification, and flexibility in responding to emerging disease outbreaks, and enhanced coverage. However, the system is not yet optimal due to incompleteness and lack of integration with other systems suggesting the need to build additional capacity for improved disease surveillance coverage, buttressed by system improvements to enhance data quality and integration. © 2022, The Author(s).},

We conducted a checklist-based assessment followed by in-depth interviews of healthcare workers in one {PMCI} each in all nine provinces. All {PMCIs} had medical/nursing officers, but data entry operators (44\%) and laboratory technicians (33\%) were mostly not available. Existing staff were assigned additional responsibilities in {PSSP}, decreasing their motivation and efficiency. While 11/18 (61\%) essential drugs were available in all {PMCIs}, buffer stocks were not maintained in {\textgreater}50\% due to poor supply chain management and storage infrastructure. Only 6/14 (43\%) essential laboratory investigations were available in {\textgreater}50\% of {PMCIs}, non-availability was due to shortages of reagents/consumables and lack of sample collection–transportation system. The {HMIS} was installed in {PMCIs} but its usage was sub-optimal due to perceived lack of utility, few trained operators and poor internet connectivity.

	abstract = {Introduction Ethiopia is one of the countries facing a very high burden of perinatal death in the world. Despite taking several measures to reduce the burden of stillbirth, the pace of decline was not that satisfactory. Although limited perinatal mortality studies were conducted at a national level, none of the studies stressed the timing of perinatal death. Thus, this study is aimed at determining the magnitude and risk factors that are associated with the timing of perinatal death in Ethiopia. Methods National perinatal death surveillance data were used in the study. A total of 3814 reviewed perinatal deaths were included in the study. Multilevel multinomial analysis was employed to examine factors associated with the timing of perinatal death in Ethiopia. The final model was reported through the adjusted relative risk ratio with its 95\% Confidence Interval, and variables with a p-value less than 0.05 were declared statistically significant predictors of the timing of perinatal death. Finally, a multi-group analysis was carried out to observe interregional variation among selected predictors. Result Among the reviewed perinatal deaths, 62.8\% occurred during the neonatal period followed by intrapartum stillbirth, unknown time of stillbirth, and antepartum stillbirth, each contributing 17.5\%,14.3\%, and 5.4\% of perinatal deaths, respectively. Maternal age, place of delivery, maternal health condition, antennal visit, maternal education, cause of death (infection and congenital and chromosomal abnormalities), and delay to decide to seek care were individual- level factors significantly associated with the timing of perinatal death. While delay reaching a health facility, delay to receive optimal care health facility, type of health facility and type region were provincial-level factors correlated with the timing of perinatal death. A statistically significant inter-regional variation was observed due to infection and congenital anomalies in determining the timing of perinatal death Conclusion Six out of ten perinatal deaths occurred during the neonatal period, and the timing of perinatal death was determined by neonatal, maternal, and facility factors. As a way forward, a concerted effort is needed to improve the community awareness of institutional delivery and {ANC} visit. Moreover, strengthening the facility level readiness in availing quality service through all paths of the continuum of care with special attention to the lower-level facilities and selected poor-performing regions is mandatory. © 2023 Public Library of Science.

	abstract = {Comprehensive and globally comparable evidence about primary health care ({PHC}) capacity is needed to inform policies and decisions. We carried out a study to assess the Ethiopian {PHC} capacity in terms of governance, inputs, and population health and facility management domains. The {PHC} capacity of all the regions, city administrations and the Ministry of Health was assessed using the {PHC} progression model. The model has 33 measures categorized into three domains. Data were collected and synthesized from all relevant national and regional documents, datasets and key informants. A team of trained evaluation experts conducted external assessments at national and regional levels followed by an internal assessment and a validation workshop. All 33 measures were scored from 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest). The inter-rater reliability test indicated that the overall agreement between internal and external scores was 65\%. We found the highest consistency in the internal assessment with a score of 0.84. The findings of this study indicated that the governance domain score was 2.8 out of 4, showing varying scores in quality management, priority setting as well as innovation and learning. The inputs domain score was 2.3 for drugs, supplies and facility infrastructure. The score for the population health and facility management domain was 2. A comparison of federal and national average scores for all measures indicated no significant difference between the two (P-value = 0.69). There are relevant {PHC} policies and leadership structures at the federal and regional levels. However, the capacity to effectively implement these policies and strategies at sub-national levels is sub-optimal. The challenges related to major inputs coupled with data-quality problems reduced the capacity of the {PHC} system at the local level. Periodic assessment of the {PHC} system and closely working with subnational units will potentially improve the capacity of {PHC} in Ethiopia.  © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Cutaneous leishmaniasis ({CL}) is the most common form of leishmaniasis that causes skin lesions on exposed parts of the body. It is endemic in over 170 districts and highly prevalent in the northern and southern parts of Ethiopia. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the determinants of {CL} among students of Wegeltena secondary school in Delanta district, Northeast Ethiopia. Methods: This unmatched case–control study was conducted from January 4 to 20, 2021 at Wegeltena secondary school. Cases were students who had an active lesion of {CL} and controls were students who had never been infected with {CL} (no active lesions). A simple random sampling technique was utilized to select participants in the control group. Data were collected by using a pretested, interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed and variables were declared determinants of {CL} at a p value of {\textless}0.05. Results: A total of 225 students (58 cases and 167 controls) participated in the study. The mean age of cases and controls was 18.6 ({SD} ± 0.99 years) and 18.5 years ({SD} ± 1.17 years), respectively. In this study, 74.1\% of cases and 51.5\% of controls have been living in rural areas. Furthermore, being male (adjusted odds ratio [{AOR}] = 4.11; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 1.94–8.69), rural residents ({AOR} = 2.95; 95\% {CI}: 1.33–6.52), living in areas where caves ({AOR} = 3.63; 95\% {CI}: 1.24–10.59), nearby forest ({AOR} = 4.04; 95\% {CI}: 1.42–11.51), and hyrax available ({AOR} = 2.43; 95\% {CI}: 1.16–5.08) were significantly associated with {CL}. Conclusion: In our study, sociodemographic and environmental factors were found to be determinants of {CL}. Therefore, reducing outdoor activities, wearing protective clothes, use of insecticide-treated nets, and destruction of sand fly breeding sites shall be implemented targeting the rural population that resides in areas where forests, caves, and hyraxes are prominent. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: Despite high coverage of maternal and child health services in Mozambique, prevention of mother-to-child transmission of {HIV} ({PMTCT}) cascade outcomes remain sub-optimal. Delivery effectiveness is modified by health system preparedness. Identifying modifiable factors that impact quality of care and service uptake can inform strategies to improve the effectiveness of {PMTCT} programs. We estimated associations between facility-level modifiable health system readiness measures and three {PMTCT} outcomes: Early infant diagnosis (polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) before 8 weeks of life), {PCR} ever (before or after 8 weeks), and positive {PCR} test result. Methods: A 2018 cross-sectional, facility-level survey was conducted in a sample of 36 health facilities covering all 12 districts in Manica province, central Mozambique, as part of a baseline assessment for the {SAIA}-{SCALE} trial ({NCT}03425136). Data on {HIV} testing outcomes among 3,427 exposed infants were abstracted from at-risk child service registries. Nine health system readiness measures were included in the analysis. Logistic regressions were used to estimate associations between readiness measures and pediatric {HIV} testing outcomes. Odds ratios ({OR}) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%{CI}) are reported. Results: Forty-eight percent of {HIV}-exposed infants had a {PCR} test within 8 weeks of life, 69\% had a {PCR} test ever, and 6\% tested positive. Staffing levels, glove stockouts, and distance to the reference laboratory were positively associated with early {PCR} ({OR} = 1.02 [95\%{CI}: 1.01–1.02], {OR} = 1.73 [95\%{CI}: 1.24–2.40] and {OR} = 1.01 [95\%{CI}: 1.00–1.01], respectively) and ever {PCR} ({OR} = 1.02 [95\%{CI}: 1.01–1.02], {OR} = 1.80 [95\%{CI}: 1.26–2.58] and {OR} = 1.01 [95\%{CI}: 1.00–1.01], respectively). Catchment area size and multiple {NGOs} supporting {PMTCT} services were associated with early {PCR} testing {OR} = 1.02 [95\%{CI}: 1.01–1.03] and {OR} = 0.54 [95\%{CI}: 0.30–0.97], respectively). Facility type, stockout of prophylactic antiretrovirals, the presence of quality improvement programs and mothers’ support groups in the health facility were not associated with {PCR} testing. No significant associations with positive {HIV} diagnosis were found. Conclusion: Salient modifiable factors associated with {HIV} testing for exposed infants include staffing levels, {NGO} support, stockout of essential commodities and accessibility of reference laboratories. Our study provides insights into modifiable factors that could be targeted to improve {PMTCT} performance, particularly at small and rural facilities. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Therefore, this study aimed to demonstrate the potential disparities in information systems in the application and data collection of health programs among Indonesian community health centers ({CHCs}) based on provinces and regions. This cross-sectional research used data from 9831 {CHCs} from the Health Facilities Research 2019 ({RIFASKES}). Significance was assessed using a chi-square test and analysis of variance ({ANOVA}). The number of applications was depicted on a map using the spmap command with {STATA} version 14. It showed that region 2, which represented Java and Bali, was the best, followed by regions 1, which comprised Sumatra Island and its surroundings, and 3, Nusa Tenggara. The highest mean, equaling that of Java, was discovered in three provinces of region 1, namely, Jambi, Lampung, and Bangka Belitung. Furthermore, Papua and West Papua had less than 60\% for all types of data-storage programs. Hence, there is a disparity in the health information system in Indonesia by province and region.

Against a screening coverage target of 50\% among individuals aged ≥ 35 years, {PMCIs} achieved 23.3\% (95\% {CI}: 23.0–23.6\%) because of a lack of perceived need for screening among the public and {COVID}-19-related service disruptions. Results of investigations and details of further referral were not documented in almost half of those screened. Post screening, 45\% of those eligible for follow-up {NCD} care were registered at medical clinics. Lack of robust recording/tracking mechanisms and preference for private providers contributed to post-screening attrition. Follow-up biochemical investigations for monitoring complications were not conducted in more than 50\% of diabetes/hypertension patients due to nonprescription of investigations by healthcare providers and poor uptake among patients because of nonavailability of investigations at {PMCI}, requiring them to avail services from the private sector, incurring out-of-pocket expenditure.

In addition, shared social, behavioural, and occupational characteristics within communities may provoke the risk of malaria infection. This study aims to understand the relationship between human mobility, livelihood activities, and the risk of malaria infection in the border region of Jazan to facilitate further strategic malaria interventions. In addition, the study will complement and reinforce the existing efforts to eliminate malaria on the Saudi and Yemen border by providing a deeper understanding of human movement and livelihood activities. Methods: An unmatched case–control study was conducted. A total of 261 participants were recruited for the study, including 81 cases of confirmed malaria through rapid diagnostic tests ({RDTs}) and microscopy and 180 controls in the Baish Governorate in Jazan Provinces, Saudi Arabia. Individuals who received malaria tests were interviewed regarding their livelihood activities and recent movement (travel history). A questionnaire was administered, and the data was captured electronically. {STATA} software version 16 was used to analyse the data. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine if engaging in agricultural activities such as farming and animal husbandry, recent travel history outside of the home village within the last 30 days and participating in spiritual gatherings were related to malaria infection status. Results: A logistical regression model was used to investigate components associated with malaria infection. After adjusting several confounding factors, individuals who reported travelling away from their home village in the last 30 days {OR} 11.5 (95\% {CI} 4.43–29.9), and those who attended a seasonal night spiritual gathering {OR} 3.04 (95\% {CI} 1.10–8.42), involved in animal husbandry {OR} 2.52 (95\% {CI} 1.10–5.82), and identified as male {OR} 4.57 (95\% {CI} 1.43–14.7), were more likely to test positive for malaria infection. Conclusion: Human movement and livelihood activities, especially at nighttime, should be considered malaria risk factors in malaria elimination settings, mainly when the targeted area is limited to a confined borderland area. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background Despite the recent interest in expanding pediatric oncology units in Ethiopia, reflected in the National Childhood and Adolescent Cancer Control Plan ({NCACCP}), little is known about the cost of running a pediatric oncology unit and treating childhood cancers. Methods We collected historical cost data and quantity of services provided for the pediatric oncology unit and all other departments in Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital ({TASH}) from 8 July 2018 to 7 July 2019, using a provider perspective and mixed (top-down and bottom-up) costing approaches. Direct costs (human resources, drugs, supplies, medical equipment) of the pediatric oncology unit, costs at other relevant clinical departments, and overhead cost share are summed up to estimate the total annual cost of running the unit. Further, unit costs were estimated at specific childhood cancer levels. Results The estimated annual total cost of running a pediatric oncology unit was {USD} 776,060 (equivalent to {USD} 577 per treated child). The cost of running a pediatric oncology unit per treated child ranged from {USD} 469 to {USD} 1,085, on the scenario-based sensitivity analysis. Drugs and supplies, and human resources accounted for 33\% and 27\% of the total cost, respectively. Outpatient department and inpatient department shared 37\% and 63\% of the cost, respectively. For the pediatric oncology unit, the cost per {OPD} visit, cost per bed day, and cost per episode of hospital admission were {USD} 36.9, 39.9, and 373.3, respectively. The annual cost per treated child ranged from {USD} 322 to {USD} 1,313 for the specific childhood cancers. Conclusion Running a pediatric oncology unit in Ethiopia is likely to be affordable. Further analysis of cost effectiveness, equity, and financial risk protection impacts of investing in childhood cancer programs could better inform the prioritization of childhood cancer control interventions in the Ethiopia Essential Health Service Package. 2023 Mirutse et al. © 2023 Public Library of Science.

Our objective is to analyse patterns of urban mental healthcare provision in Australia, and compare these with relevant national and international regions to inform urban mental healthcare policy and planning. Following a health ecosystems approach, we use a standardised service classification instrument, the Description and Evaluation of Services and {DirectoriEs} ({DESDE}), and Mental Health Care Atlases, to compare the availability, bed capacity and diversity of services providing specialised mental health or psychosocial care that are universally accessible (ie provided at no or low cost only in all relevant care sectors in four Australian and three international urban regions. We used a heuristics approach and an homogeneity test. Applicability to local policy was assessed using the Adoption Impact Ladder. Community care was less developed in Australia than internationally, except in the case of residential care in Australian Capital Territory, our reference area. Alternatives to hospitalisation were scarce across all regions. The Atlas was applicable to regional and local mental health planning. Differences in pattern of care between regions has implications for planning, equality of access to care and prioritisation of resources. An ecosystems approach is relevant to service planning in mental healthcare at local level. © 2023 Furst et al.

	abstract = {Health facility assessments ({HFAs}) assessing facilities' readiness to provide services are well-established. However, {HFA} questionnaires are typically quantitative and lack depth to understand systems in which health facilities operate - crucial to designing context-oriented interventions. We report lessons from a multiple embedded case study exploring the experiences of {HFA} data collectors in implementing a novel {HFA} tool developed using systems thinking approach. We assessed 16 hospitals in four countries (Benin, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda) as part of a quality improvement implementation research. Our tool was organized in 17 sections and included dimensions of hospital governance, leadership and financing; maternity care standards and procedures; ongoing quality improvement practices; interactions with communities and mapping of the areas related to maternal care. Data for this study were collected using in-depth interviews with senior experts who conducted the {HFA} in the countries 1-3 months after completion of the {HFAs}. Data were analysed using the inductive thematic analysis approach. Our {HFA} faced challenges in logistics (accessing key hospital-based respondents, high turnover of managerial staff and difficulty accessing information considered sensitive in the context) and methodology (response bias, lack of data quality and data entry into an electronic platform). Data elements of governance, leadership and financing were the most affected. Opportunities and strategies adopted aimed at enhancing data collection (building on prior partnerships and understanding local and institutional bureaucracies) and enhancing data richness (identifying respondents with institutional memory, learning from experience and conducting observations at various times). Moreover, {HFA} data collectors conducted abstraction of records and interviews in a flexible and adaptive way to enhance data quality. Lessons and new skills learned from our {HFA} could be used as inputs to respond to the growing need of integrating the systems thinking approach in {HFA} to improve the contextual understanding of operations and structure.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Inappropriate practices, including unjustified medication prescriptions, pose challenges in the management of acute diarrhea ({AD}), especially in low- and middle-income countries. Objective: This study analyzed antibiotic prescription patterns and assessed compliance with Integrated Management of Childhood Illness ({IMCI}) guidelines in children under 5 with {AD} in the Ministry of Public Health ({MOPH}) Ambulatory Care Centers of Quito city, Ecuador. Methods: A cross-sectional design was used, collecting electronic health records ({EHR}) of patients diagnosed with {AD} from 21 health facilities in District 17D03. A probabilistic and stratified sampling approach was applied. Patient characteristics, prescriber characteristics, treatments, and compliance of {IMCI} guideline recommendations were evaluated. A stepwise logistic regression analysis examined the association between antibiotic prescription and patient and physician characteristics. Results: A total of 359 children under 5 years of age were included, with 58.77\% being girls. 85.24\% of the cases of {AD} were attributed to gastroenteritis and colitis of infectious and unspecified origin. Amebiasis and other protozoal intestinal diseases accounted for 13.37\% and 1.11\% of the cases, respectively. The completion rates of recording various {IMCI} parameters varied; parameters such as duration of diarrhea, presence of blood in stool, and evidence of sunken eyes had high completion rates (100\%, 100\%, and 87.47\%, respectively), while parameters like state of consciousness, presence of thirst, and type of diarrhea had low completion rates (0.28\%, 0.28\%, and 0.84\%, respectively). None of the cases had all parameters fully recorded. Antimicrobials were prescribed in 38.72\% of the cases. Children aged 3 to 5 years had higher odds of receiving antimicrobial prescription for {AD} ({aOR}: 4.42, 95\% {CI} 2.13-9.18, P {\textless}.0001) compared to those under 1 year, after adjusting for the number of loose stools per day, gender, and age of the health professional. Conclusion: Variations in {IMCI} guideline compliance were observed, with no cases fully adhering to the guidelines. Antimicrobial prescription rates were notably high, especially among older children. Further research and specialized interventions are necessary to gain comprehensive insight into the factors underlying non-compliance with the {IMCI} guidelines. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Background: The attainment of targets set for modern contraceptive use remains a challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. Rwanda, in its new Family Planning and Adolescent Sexual Reproductive Health/Family Planning ({FP}/{ASRH}) Strategic Plan 2018–2024 has set the attainment of a contraceptive prevalence rate ({CPR}) of 60\% by 2024. To achieve this, identifying factors that enhance modern contraceptive use among sexually active women is critical. Methods: We used three Rwanda Demographic Health Surveys ({RDHS}) datasets collected in 2010, 2015, and 2019/2020 in a multivariable decomposition analysis technique to describe trends and identify factors influencing change in modern contraceptive use among sexually active women aged 15–49 years. Results presented as coefficients and percentages took into consideration the complex survey design weighted using {StataSE} 17. Results: Modern contraceptive use increased from 40\% in 2010 to 52.4\% in 2020 among sexually active women. About 23.7\% of the overall percentage change in modern contraceptive use was attributable to women’s characteristics which included women’s education levels, number of living children, and being told about family planning at health facilities. Coefficients contributed 76.26\% to the change in modern contraceptive use. This change was attributed to modern contraceptive use among young women between the age of 20–24 years, women’s education level, the number of living children, changes in family size, and being visited by community health workers. Conclusion: Rwanda remains on course to archive its 2024 family planning targets. However, there is a need to enhance programs that target sexually active adolescents and young adults, and women from rural areas to sustain the gains made. Furthermore, continuous support of community health workers will be key in exceeding the set targets of modern contraceptive use among sexually active women in Rwanda. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This article is part of the Research Topic: ‘Health Systems Recovery in the Context of {COVID}-19 and Protracted Conflict.’ Problem: Many countries lacked rapid and nimble data systems to track health service capacities to respond to {COVID}-19. They struggled to assess and monitor rapidly evolving service disruptions, health workforce capacities, health products availability, community needs and perspectives, and mitigation responses to maintain essential health services. Method: Building on established methodologies, the World Health Organization developed a suite of methods and tools to support countries to rapidly fill data gaps and guide decision-making during {COVID}-19. The tools included: (1) a national “pulse” survey on service disruptions and bottlenecks; (2) a phone-based facility survey on frontline service capacities; and (3) a phone-based community survey on demand-side challenges and health needs. Use: Three national pulse surveys revealed persisting service disruptions throughout 2020–2021 (97 countries responded to all three rounds). Results guided mitigation strategies and operational plans at country level, and informed investments and delivery of essential supplies at global level. Facility and community surveys in 22 countries found similar disruptions and limited frontline service capacities at a more granular level. Findings informed key actions to improve service delivery and responsiveness from local to national levels. Lessons learned: The rapid key informant surveys provided a low-resource way to collect action-oriented health services data to inform response and recovery from local to global levels. The approach fostered country ownership, stronger data capacities, and integration into operational planning. The surveys are being evaluated to inform integration into country data systems to bolster routine health services monitoring and serve as health services alert functions for the future.

	abstract = {Introduction: Stunning recent increases in subdermal contraceptive implant use, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, necessitate availability of quality implant removal services. In Nigeria, service delivery capacity and coverage for removal are lacking, despite strong government commitment and rapid uptake; there is a dearth of knowledge about barriers to quality implant removals in Nigeria. Methods: To determine access to and quality of contraceptive implant removal services, a landscape assessment was conducted in two states in Nigeria, focusing on four conditions for quality delineated in the Global Implant Removals Task Force framework. This mixed-methods approach integrated results from a desk review, a survey of health facilities and family planning managers, review of implant service statistics, and key informant interviews with providers and diverse stakeholders. Results: Seventy percent of providers (N = 21 of 30) had experienced problems performing implant removal, usually due to deeply inserted implants and equipment shortages. Providers had low confidence in performing removal and poor knowledge of implant removal steps. No facilities assessed had comprehensive equipment required for implant removal. Few facilities maintained systems or referral pathways to support difficult removals; difficult removals are absent from training manuals, and no formal trainings have been conducted. While most facilities collect data on removals, family planning dashboards do not capture it; few facilities use data for quality improvement. Conclusion: This study identified numerous challenges to quality implant removal, including poorly trained providers, inadequate supplies, underutilization of data on removals, and inability to manage difficult removals. As demand for implant removals skyrockets, providers need improved training in implant removal, appropriate job aids, supportive supervision, and effective procurement systems to ensure availability of supplies and equipment for removal. Tracking removals and reasons for removal in information systems and the Family Planning dashboard could sensitize providers to need for implant removals and improve data for decision-making in facilities and health systems. 2023 Adetiloye, Danladi, Haws, Anoke, Odio, Ugwa, Nganje, Enne, Afolabi, Adebola, Eze and Christofield.},

	abstract = {Background: In Ethiopia, public hospitals deal with a persistent human resource crisis, even by Sub-Saharan Africa ({SSA}) standards. Policy and hospital reforms, however, have thus far resulted in limited progress towards addressing the strategic human resource management ({SHRM}) challenges Ethiopia’s public hospitals face. Methods: To explore the contextual factors influencing these {SHRM} challenges of Ethiopian public hospitals, we conducted a qualitative study based on the Contextual {SHRM} framework of Paauwe. A total of 19 structured interviews were conducted with Chief Executive Officers ({CEOs}) and {HR} managers from a purposive sample of 15 hospitals across Ethiopia. An additional four focus groups were held with professionals and managers. Results: The study found that hospitals compete on the supply side for scarce resources, including skilled professionals. There was little reporting on demand-side competition for health services provided, service quality, and service innovation. Governmental regulations were the main institutional mechanism in place. These regulations also emphasized human resources and were perceived to tightly regulate employee numbers, salaries, and employment arrangements at detailed levels. These regulations were perceived to restrict the autonomy of hospitals regarding {SHRM}. Regulation-induced differences in allowances and external employment arrangements were among the concerns that decreased motivation and job satisfaction and caused employees to leave. The mismatch between regulation and workforce demands posed challenges for leadership and caused leaders to be perceived as incompetent and unable when they could not successfully address workforce needs. Conclusions: Bottom-up involvement in {SHRM} may help resolve the aforementioned persistent problems. The Ethiopian government might better loosen regulations and provide more autonomy to hospitals to develop {SHRM} and implement mechanisms that emphasize the quality of the health services demanded rather than the quantity of human resources supplied. © 2022, The Author(s).},

              The objective of this study was to assess the readiness of health facilities for diabetes and cardiovascular services in Bangladesh.
            
            
              Design
              This study was a cross-sectional survey.
            
            
              Setting
              This study used data from a nationwide Bangladesh Health Facility Survey conducted by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in 2014.
            
            
              Participants
              A total of 319 health facilities delivering services focused on diabetes and cardiovascular diseases ({CVD}) were included in the survey. Some of these facilities were run by the public sector while others were managed by the private sector and non-governmental organisations. It was a mix of primary and secondary care facilities.
            
            
              Primary and secondary outcome measures
              The primary outcome was readiness of health facilities for diabetes and cardiovascular services. We analysed relevant data following the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment manual of the {WHO} to assess the readiness of selected health facilities towards services for diabetes and {CVD}.
            
            
              Results
              58\% and 24.1\% of the facilities had diagnosis and treatment services for diabetes and {CVD}, respectively. Shortage of trained staff (18.8\% and 14.7\%) and lack of adequate medicine supply (23.5\% and 43.9\%) were identified to be factors responsible for inadequate services for diabetes and {CVD}. Among the facilities that offer services for diabetes and {CVD}, only 0.4\% and 0.9\% had all the four service readiness factors (guideline, trained staff, equipment and medicine).
            
            
              Conclusions
              The study suggests that health facilities suffered from numerous drawbacks, such as shortage of trained staff and required medicine. Most importantly, they lack effective guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment for diabetes and {CVD}. It is, therefore, essential now to ensure that there are trained staff, adequate medicine supply, and appropriate guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment for diabetes and {CVD} in Bangladesh.},

	abstract = {Aims The aim of this study was to describe the current pathways of care for patients with a fracture of the hip in five low-and middle-income countries ({LMIC}) in South Asia (Nepal and Sri Lan-ka) and Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines). Methods The World Health Organization Service Availability and Readiness Assessment tool was used to collect data on the care of hip fractures in Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. Respondents were asked to provide details about the current pathway of care for patients with hip fracture, including pre-hospital transport, time to admission, time to sur-gery, and time to weightbearing, along with healthcare professionals involved at different stages of care, information on discharge, and patient follow- up. Results Responses were received from 98 representative hospitals across the five countries. Most hospitals were publicly funded. There was consistency in clinical pathways of care within country, but considerable variation between countries. Patients mostly travel to hospital via ambulance (both publicly-and privately-funded) or private transport, with only half arriving at hospital within 12 hours of their injury. Access to surgery was variable and time to surgery ranged between one day and more than five days. The majority of hospitals mobilized pa-tients on the first or second day after surgery, but there was notable variation in postopera-tive weightbearing protocols. Senior medical input was variable and specialist orthogeriatric expertise was unavailable in most hospitals. Conclusion This study provides the first step in mapping care pathways for patients with hip fracture in {LMIC} in South Asia. The previous lack of data in these countries hampers efforts to identify quality standards (key performance indicators) that are relevant to each different healthcare system.},

	issn = {1478-4491},
	doi = {10.1186/1478-4491-10-13},
	abstract = {Background: Although rates of maternal and neonatal mortality have decreased in many countries over the last two decades, they remain unacceptably high, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, we know little about the quality of facility-based maternal and newborn care in low-income countries and little about the association between quality of care and health worker training, supervision, and incentives in these settings. We therefore sought to examine the quality of facility-based maternal and newborn health care by describing the implementation of recommended practices for maternal and newborn care among health care facilities. We also aimed to determine whether increased training, supervision, and incentives for health workers were associated with implementing these recommended practices. We chose to study these aims in the Republic of Rwanda, where rates of maternal and newborn mortality are high and where substantial attention is currently focused on strengthening health workforce capacity and quality. Methods: We used data from the 2007 Rwanda Service Provision Assessment. Using observations from 455 facilities and interviews from 1357 providers, we generated descriptive statistics to describe the use of recommended practices and frequencies of provider training, supervision, and incentives in the areas of antenatal, delivery, and newborn care. We then constructed multivariable regression models to examine the associations between using recommended practices and health provider training, supervision, and incentives. Results: Use of recommended practices varied widely, and very few facilities performed all recommended practices. Furthermore, in most areas of care, less than 25\% of providers reported having had any pre-service or in-service training in the last 3 years. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found no evidence that training, supervision, or incentives were consistently associated with using recommended practices. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the need to improve facility-based maternal and newborn care in Rwanda and suggest that current approaches to workforce training, supervision, and incentives may not be adequate for improving these critical practices.},

The aim of this study was to assess the availability, quality and equity of emergency obstetric care ({EmOC}) in the {DRC}.{MethodsA} cross-sectional survey of 1,568 health facilities selected by multistage random sampling in 11 provinces of the {DRC} was conducted in 2014. Data were collected through interviews, document reviews, and direct observation of service delivery. Collected data included availability, quality, and equity of {EmOC} depending on the location (urban vs. rural), administrative identity, type of facility, and province. Associations between variables were tested by Pearson's chi-squared test using an alpha significance level of 0.05.{ResultsA} total of 1,555 health facilities (99.2\%) were surveyed. Of these, 9.1\% provided basic {EmOC} and 2.9\% provided comprehensive {EmOC}. The care was unequally distributed across the provinces and urban vs. rural areas; it was more available in urban areas, with the provinces of Kinshasa and Nord-Kivu being favored compared to other provinces. Caesarean section and blood transfusions were provided by health centers (6.5 and 9.0\%, respectively) and health posts (2.3 and 2.3\%, respectively), despite current guidelines disallowing the practice. None of the facilities provided quality {EmOC}, mainly due to the lack of proper standards and guidelines.{ConclusionsThe} distribution and quality of {EmOC} are problematic. The lack of regulation and monitoring appears to be a key contributing factor. We recommend the Ministry of Health go beyond merely granting funds, and also ensure the establishment and monitoring of appropriate standard operating procedures for providers.},

	abstract = {Background Each year an estimated 2.6 million newborns die, mainly from complications of prematurity, neonatal infections, and intrapartum events. Reducing these deaths requires high coverage of good quality care at birth, and inpatient care for small and sick newborns. In low- and middle-income countries, standardised measurement of the readiness of facilities to provide emergency obstetric care has improved tracking of readiness to provide care at birth in recent years. However, the focus has been mainly on obstetric care; service readiness for providing inpatient care of small and sick newborns is still not consistently measured or tracked. Methods We reviewed existing international guidelines and resources to create a matrix of the structural characteristics (infrastructure, equipment, drugs, providers and guidelines) for service readiness to deliver a package of inpatient care interventions for small and sick newborns. To identify gaps in existing measurement systems, we reviewed three multi-country health facility survey tools (the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment, the Service Provision Assessment and the Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care Assessment) against our service readiness matrix. Findings For service readiness to provide inpatient care for small and sick newborns, our matrix detailed over 600 structural characteristics. Our review of the {SPA}, the {SARA} and the {EmONC} assessment tools identified several measurement omissions to capture information on key intervention areas, such as thermoregulation, feeding and respiratory support, treatment of specific complications (seizures, jaundice), and screening and follow up services, as well as specialised staff and service infrastructure. Conclusions Our review delineates the required inputs to ensure readiness to provide inpatient care for small and sick newborns. Based on these findings, we detail where questions need to be added to existing tools and describe how measurement systems can be adapted to reflect small and sick newborns interventions. Such work can inform investments in health systems to end preventable newborn death and disability as part of the Every Newborn Action Plan.},

Qualitative information was collected via Field Observations, Key informant interviews and Focus group discussion with stakeholders ranging from leaders to laggards. A concise index of General Service Availability, Service Specific Availability and Facility Readiness was computed along with exploratory data analysis using Principal Component Analysis. Further, determinants of facility readiness were elucidated using Generalized Ordinal Logistic Model. Qualitative findings were analyzed via content analysis. Results indicated poorest readiness in lower-tier facilities with particularly abysmal readiness for basic amenities, diagnostic capacity and preparedness for emergencies and non-communicable diseases. The estimates for logistic model revealed that degree of vulnerability of facilities, type of facility and frequency of monitoring and supervision significantly impacted the readiness. Qualitative analysis divulged lack of incentives for health workers, political interference, topographical constraints and security disruptions as major barriers stymieing service provisioning in study area.},

In these networks, the transmission of messages or the Guaranteed Time Slot allocation are coordinated by the traditional {CSMA}/{CA} scheme, which does not provide any additional traffic differentiation mechanism. In a previous work, we proposed an approach that assigns priorities to the messages based on the (m, k)-firm task model. This paper proposes, in a complementary way, an experimental assessment in order to define the best parameters for messages prioritization. The experimental assessment considers a realistic scenario in which a set of sensor nodes, implementing the proposed scheme works in the same coverage area of another set of nodes that does not belong to the same Wireless Sensor Networks infrastructure.},

This study evaluates the current capacity of facilities and providers for {HIV} care and treatment services and their preparedness to adhere to the national and global precaution guidelines for {HIV} service providers and patients. Methods: data for this study come from the latest available, Tanzania Service Provision Assessment survey 2014-15. Frequencies and percentages described the readiness and availability of {HIV} services and providers. Chi-square test compared the distribution of services by facility location and availability and readiness of precaution commodities and {HIV} services by managing authorities. Results: availability of latex gloves was high (83\% at {OPD} and 95.3\% laboratory). Availability of medical masks, alcohol-based hand rub and disinfectants was low. Availability of medical mask at outpatient department ({OPD}) was 28.7\% urban (23.5\% public; 33.8\% private, p=0.02) and 13.5\% rural (10.1\% public; 25.4\% private, p=0.001) and lower at laboratories. Fewer facilities in rural area (68.4\%) had running water in {OPD} than urban (86.3\%). Higher proportions of providers at public than private facilities in urban (82.8\% versus 73.1\%) and rural (88.2\% versus 81.6\%) areas provided {HIV} test counseling and at least two other {HIV} services. Conclusion: availability of commodities such as medical masks, alcohol-based hand rub, and disinfectant was low while the readiness of providers to multitask {HIV} related services was high. Urgent distribution and reassessment of these supplies are necessary, to protect {HIV} patients, their caregivers, and health providers from {COVID}-19.},

	abstract = {Pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria are leading causes of under-5 mortality. Accelerated reductions in illness burden are needed to meet childhood Sustainable Development Goals. Understand-ing where parents take sick children for care is key to improving equitable, high-quality treatment for these childhood illnesses and catalyzing reductions in morbidity and mortality. We analyzed the most recent Demographic and Health Survey data in 24 of the United States Agency for International Development’s maternal and child health priority countries to examine levels and sources of care for children sick with 3 illness classifications: symptoms of acute respiratory infection, diarrhea, or fever. On average, across countries analyzed, one-third of children had recent experience with at least 1 of the 3 classifications. The majority (68.2\%) of caregivers sought external advice or treatment for their sick children, though the level is far higher for the wealthiest (74.3\%) than poorest (63.1\%) families. Among those who sought out-of-home care, 51.1\% used public sources and 42.5\% used private-sector sources. Although sources for sick child care varied substantially by region and country, they were consistent across the 3 illness classifications. Urban and wealthier families reported more use of private sources compared with rural and poorer families. Though 35.2\% of the poorest families used private sources, most of these (57.2\%) were retail outlets like pharmacies and shops, while most wealthier families who sought care in the private sector went to health facilities (62.4\%). Efforts to strengthen the quality of integrated management of sick child care must therefore reach both public and private facilities as well as private pharmacies, shops, and other retail outlets. Stakeholders across sectors must collaborate to reach all population groups with high-quality child health services and reduce disparities in care-seeking behaviors. Such cross-sectoral efforts will build clinical and institutional capacity and more efficiently allocate resources, ultimately resulting in stronger, more resilient health systems.},

	abstract = {Background Pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malaria are among the leading causes of death in children. These deaths are largely preventable if appropriate care is sought early. This review aimed to determine the percentage of caregivers in low- and middle-income countries ({LMICs}) with a child less than 5 years who were able to recognise illness in their child and subsequently sought care from different types of healthcare providers. Methods and Findings We conducted a systematic literature review of studies that reported recognition of, and/or care seeking for episodes of diarrhoea, pneumonia or malaria in {LMICs}. The review is registered with {PROSPERO} (registration number: {CRD}42011001654). Ninety-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Eighteen studies reported data on caregiver recognition of disease and seventy-seven studies on care seeking. The median sensitivity of recognition of diarrhoea, malaria and pneumonia was low (36.0\%, 37.4\%, and 45.8\%, respectively). A median of 73.0\% of caregivers sought care outside the home. Care seeking from community health workers (median: 5.4\% for diarrhoea, 4.2\% for pneumonia, and 1.3\% for malaria) and the use of oral rehydration therapy (median: 34\%) was low. Conclusions Given the importance of this topic to child survival programmes there are few published studies. Recognition of diarrhoea, malaria and pneumonia by caregivers is generally poor and represents a key factor to address in attempts to improve health care utilisation. In addition, considering that oral rehydration therapy has been widely recommended for over forty years, its use remains disappointingly low. Similarly, the reported levels of care seeking from community health workers in the included studies are low even though global action plans to address these illnesses promote community case management. Giving greater priority to research on care seeking could provide crucial evidence to inform child mortality programmes.},

It concentrates on the major causes of maternal mortality, and traces their antecedent morbidities and risk factors in pregnancy.

This is an updated and expanded version of a review first published by the World Health Organization ({WHO}) in 1992. The scientific evidence from randomised controlled trials and other types of intervention or observational study on the effectiveness of these interventions is reviewed critically. The sources and quality of available data, and possible biases in their collection or interpretation are considered. As in other areas of maternal health, good-quality evidence is scarce and, just as in many aspects of health care generally, there are interventions in current practice that have not been subjected to rigorous evaluation. A table of antenatal interventions of proven effectiveness in conditions that can lead to maternal mortality or serious morbidity is presented. Interventions for which there is some promising evidence, short of proof, of effectiveness are explored, and the outstanding questions formulated. These are presented in a series of tables with suggestions about the types of study needed to answer them.},

	abstract = {Background Newborns are at greatest risk of dying at and shortly after the time of birth. Newborn mortality remains an urgent concern and is an important indicator of child health, development and well-being. Studies examining the effectiveness of antenatal care on maternal and newborn health outcomes have provided conflicting results. The aim of this review and meta-analysis was to determine the pooled effect of antenatal care on neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We searched {PubMed}, Medline, {EMBASE}, {CINAHL} and Google Scholar from September to November 2016 and then updated our search on April 13, 2019. Two independent reviewers extracted data from eligible studies. The quality of each included study was assessed using the Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Non-Randomized Studies ({RoBANS}). The results were reported based on risk ratio ({RR}) with 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) using a random-effects model. Results Eight hundred and ninety eight studies were initially identified. During screening, 23 studies were found to be relevant for data extraction. Of these, only twelve studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. In five of the twelve studies included in the analysis, antenatal care service utilization had a significant association with neonatal mortality. The pooled risk ratio by the random-effects model was 0.61 (95\% {CI}: 0.43, 0.86) for neonates born to women who received at least one antenatal care visit by a skilled provider as compared to neonates born to women who did not receive antenatal care. Conclusion This review indicates that utilization of at least one antenatal care visit by a skilled provider during pregnancy reduces the risk of neonatal mortality by 39\% in sub-Saharan African countries. Thus, in order to accelerate progress towards the reduction of newborn deaths, all pregnant women should receive antenatal care during pregnancy.},

Methods We searched Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central databases and grey literature for experimental, quasi-experimental and observational studies that had been conducted in low- and middle-income countries. We summarized the relevant studies qualitatively and performed meta-analyses of the use of postnatal care services according to selected indicators of socioeconomic status and residence in an urban or rural setting. Findings A total of 36 studies were included in the narrative synthesis and 10 of them were used for the meta-analyses. Compared with women in the lowest quintile of socioeconomic status, the pooled odds ratios for use of postnatal care by women in the second, third, fourth and fifth quintiles were: 1.14 (95\% confidence interval, {CI} : 0.96–1.34), 1.32 (95\% {CI}: 1.12–1.55), 1.60 (95\% {CI}: 1.30–1.98) and 2.27 (95\% {CI}: 1.75–2.93) respectively. Compared to women living in rural settings, the pooled odds ratio for the use of postnatal care by women living in urban settings was 1.36 (95\% {CI}: 1.01–1.81). A qualitative assessment of the relevant published data also indicated that use of postnatal care services increased with increasing level of education. Conclusion In low- and middle-income countries, use of postnatal care services remains highly inequitable and varies markedly with socioeconomic status and between urban and rural residents.},

	abstract = {Objective To explore the factors associated with antenatal care ({ANC}) visits.
Design A secondary data analysis from cross-sectional studies was conducted.
Setting Sub-Saharan Africa.
Participants 56 002 women aged 15–49 years in Ghana (3224), Kenya (10 981), Malawi (9541), Namibia (2286), Rwanda (4416), Senegal (6552), Tanzania (5536), Uganda (7979) and Zambia (5487) were analysed.
Outcomes 4+{ANC} visits.
Results Overall, 55.52\% (95\% {CI}: 55.11\% to 55.93\%) of women made 4+{ANC} visits. The highest 4+{ANC} visits were in Ghana (85.6\%) and Namibia (78.9\%), and the lowest were in Senegal (45.3\%) and Rwanda (44.5\%). Young women 15–19 years had the lowest uptake of 4+{ANC} visits. Multivariable analysis indicated that the odds of 4+{ANC} visits were 14\% lower among women from rural areas compared with those living in towns (adjusted {OR} ({AOR}) 0.86; 95\% {CI}: 0.81 to 0.91). This difference was significant in Kenya, Malawi, Senegal and Zambia. However, in Zambia, the odds of 4+{ANC} visits were 48\% higher ({AOR} 1.48; 95\% {CI}: 1.2 to 1.82) among women from rural compared with urban areas. Women with higher educational level had more than twofold higher odds of 4+{ANC} visits in seven of the nine countries, and was significant in Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda and Zambia. Compared with the poorest household wealth category, odds of 4+{ANC} visits increased by 12\%, 18\%, 32\% and 41\% for every 20\% variation on the wealth quantile. Women in their first-time pregnancy had higher odds of 4+{ANC} visits compared with others across all countries, and women who had access to media at least once a week had a 22\% higher probability of 4+{ANC} visits than women who had no access to media ({AOR} 1.22, 95\% {CI}: 1.15 to 1.29).
Conclusion The number of {ANC} visits was considered to be inadequate with substantial variation among the studied countries. Comprehensive interventions on scaling uptake of {ANC} are needed among the low-performing countries. Particular attention should be given to women of low economic status and from rural areas.},

However, the focus of {NHIS} is on the demand side of healthcare delivery. Studies focusing on the supply side of healthcare delivery, particularly the quality of service as perceived by the consumers are required. A growing number of studies have focused on regional differences of patient satisfaction in developed countries, however little research has been conducted concerning patient satisfaction in resource-poor settings like in Ghana.

While health insurance has been shown as effective in the utilisation of maternal healthcare, there is a paucity of literature on this relationship in sub-Saharan Africa ({SSA}). We examined the relationship between health insurance coverage and maternal healthcare utilisation using demographic and health survey data.This was a cross-sectional study of 195 651 women aged 15–49 y from 28 countries in {SSA}. We adopted bivariable and multivariable analyses comprising χ2 test and multilevel binary logistic regression in analysing the data.The prevalence of maternal healthcare utilisation was 58, 70.6 and 40.7\% for antenatal care ({ANC}), skilled birth attendance ({SBA}) and postnatal care ({PNC}), respectively. The prevalence of health insurance coverage was 6.4\%. Women covered by health insurance were more likely to utilise {ANC} (adjusted {OR} [{aOR}]=1.48, 95\% {CI} 1.41 to 1.54), {SBA} ({aOR}=1.37, 95\% {CI} 1.30 to 1.45) and {PNC} ({aOR}=1.42, 95\% {CI} 1.37 to 1.48).Health insurance coverage was an important predictor of maternal healthcare utilisation in our study. To accelerate progress towards the achievement of {SDG} 3 targets related to the reduction of maternal mortality and achievement of {UHC}, countries should adopt interventions to increase maternal insurance coverage, which may lead to higher maternal healthcare access and utilisation during pregnancy.},

	abstract = {Background One of the greatest obstacles facing efforts to address quality of care in low and middle income countries is the absence of relevant and reliable data. This article proposes a methodology for creating a single “Quality Index” ({QI}) representing quality of maternal and neonatal health care based upon data collected as part of the Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}) program. Methods Using the 2012 Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey dataset, indicators of quality of care were identified based on the recommended guidelines outlined in the {WHO} Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth. Two sets of indicators were created; one set only including indicators available in the standard {DHS} questionnaire and the other including all indicators identified in the Indonesian dataset. For each indicator set composite indices were created using Principal Components Analysis and a modified form of Equal Weighting. These indices were tested for internal coherence and robustness, as well as their comparability with each other. Finally a single {QI} was chosen to explore the variation in index scores across a number of known equity markers in Indonesia including wealth, urban rural status and geographical region. Results The process of creating quality indexes from standard {DHS} data was proven to be feasible, and initial results from Indonesia indicate particular disparities in the quality of care received by the poor as well as those living in outlying regions. Conclusions The {QI} represents an important step forward in efforts to understand, measure and improve quality of {MNCH} care in developing countries.},

	abstract = {Objectives To examine how maternal and sociodemographic factors determine continued care-seeking behaviour from pregnancy to postnatal period in Kenya and Uganda and to determine associated neonatal survival outcomes.
Design A population-based analysis of cross-sectional data using multinomial and binary logistic regressions.
Setting Countrywide, Kenya and Uganda.
Participants Most recent live births of 24 502 mothers within 1–59 months prior to the 2014–2016 Demographic and Health Surveys.
Outcomes Care-seeking continuum and neonatal mortality.
Results Overall, 57\% of the mothers had four or more antenatal care ({ANC}) contacts, of which 73\% and 41\% had facility births and postnatal care ({PNC}), respectively. Maternal/paternal education versus no education was associated with continued care seeking in majority of care-seeking classes; relative risk ratios ({RRRs}) ranged from 2.1 to 8.0 (95\% {CI} 1.1 to 16.3). Similarly, exposure to mass media was generally associated with continued care seekin; {RRRs} ranged from 1.8 to 3.2 (95\% {CI} 1.2 to 5.4). Care-seeking tendency reduced if a husband made major maternal care-seeking decisions. Transportation problems and living in rural versus urban were largely associated with lower continued care use; {RRR} ranged from 0.4 to 0.7 (95\% {CI} 0.3 to 0.9). The two lowest care-seeking categories with no {ANC} and no {PNC} indicated the highest odds for neonatal mortality (adjusted {OR} 4.2, 95\% {CI} 1.6 to 10.9). 23\% neonatal deaths were attributable to inadequate maternal care attendance.
Conclusion Strategies such as mobile health specifically for promoting continued maternal care use up to postnatal could be integrated in the existing structures. Another strategy would be to develop and employ a brief standard questionnaire to determine a mother’s continued care-seeking level during the first {ANC} visit and to use the information to close the care-seeking gaps. Strengthening the community health workers system to be an integral part of promoting continued care seeking could enhance care seeking as a stand-alone strategy or as a component of aforementioned suggested strategies.},

Objective:\&nbsp; To assess the clients’ knowledge and satisfaction with antenatal care ({ANC}) services in Primary Health Centres in Ikenne Local Government Area of Ogun State, Nigeria.
Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 380 registered pregnant women who were selected using a multistage sampling method. The data were collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire, constructed from a review of the Safe Motherhood Needs Assessment package and other available literature on antenatal care.
Results: The mean age of the respondents was 27.8±5.5 years. The majority were married (91.6\%). Health education was the leading {ANC} activity recognized by 98.7\% of the respondents. Knowledge was poor as only 46.1\% had good knowledge of at least 50\% of total knowledge score. Overall, satisfaction with the services was good as the majority (96.8\%) of the respondents were satisfied with the services. Marital status, number of antenatal visits and level of education were statistically significantly associated with the level of satisfaction (p \&lt; 0.001, 0.02 and 0.007 respectively).
Conclusion: Though the knowledge of {ANC} was poor, overall satisfaction level was good. Programmes that improve maternal knowledge about {ANC} should be emphasized in {PHCs}.},

	abstract = {To examine the relationship between patient satisfaction and doctor performance, the authors observed 2,271 interactions between 292 doctors and their patients in 98 clinics and hospitals in Paraguay and conducted an exit-survey with the same patients as they left the clinic. For a subsample of 64 facilities they also interviewed patients who visited the facility within the last week. There are three patterns in the data: (1) Patient satisfaction is positively correlated with doctor effort, measured as a combination of time spent, questions asked, and examinations performed after controlling for observed doctor and patient characteristics; (2) However, accounting for unobserved doctor characteristics dramatically reduces the level of significance and size of correlation between effort and satisfaction, showing that much of the positive relationship is driven by these unobserved doctor-specific factors; and (3) Reported satisfaction is significantly lower for patients interviewed at home compared with those interviewed at the clinic. This leads the authors to conclude that even if patient satisfaction reflects some aspects of the doctor's performance, unobserved heterogeneity combined with survey biases limit the widespread applicability of patient satisfaction as an indicator of doctor performance.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Globally, low-middle-income countries continue to account for almost all of the pregnancy-related mortalities that are largely preventable through adequate utilization of essential maternal health care services such as antenatal care ({ANC}) and skilled birth assistance ({SBA}). Promoting the use of {ANC} and {SBA} services are hindered by numerous policy- and capacity-related barriers along with widespread inequality in utilization of the existing services that further exacerbates the scenario. In an attempt to better understand the geography of inequality in service utilization, we conducted this brief descriptive study by using World Health Organization ({WHO}) data on {ANC} and {SBA} utilization among the member states.

Methods: This was a descriptive study based on open access data on {ANC} and {SBA} use between 2012 and 2015 available through the Global Health Observatory of {WHO}. Country-level data were collected for Asia (41 countries), Africa (35 countries), Europe (35 countries), North America (10 countries), Latin America and the Caribbean (25 countries), and Oceania (16 countries). Cross-country and continent comparisons were made using dot and bar charts.

Results: The overall prevalence of {ANC} and {SBA} use were, respectively, 78.17\% and 88.33\%. Considerable disparities were found in terms of {ANC} and {SBA} use across the continents, especially in Asia and Africa. Globally, the poorest performing countries included Afghanistan, Somalia, and South Sudan where more than three-quarters of the women remain deprived of {ANC} and {SBA} services during the period of 2012 and 2015. The greatest inequality in {ANC} use was observed in Africa (9.4\% in Somalia and 99.9\% in Libya), whereas that of {SBA} use was observed in Asia (17.8\% in Afghanistan vs. 100\% in Bahrain). Europe was the most equal of all regions in terms of both {ANC} (66.8\% in Albania vs. 99.7\% in Belarus) and {SBA} (94.4\% in Denmark vs. 100\% in Lithuania) use.

Conclusion: Although in the majority of countries more than three-quarters of the women receive {ANC} and {SBA} services, the extent of intraregional inequality remains overwhelming especially for Asia and Africa. Progress toward maternal health-related targets should be interpreted in terms of the disparities to ensure a more even and sustainable outcome at both national and global level.},

	abstract = {Background
Antenatal care ({ANC}) is an important opportunity to diagnose and treat pregnancy-related complications and to deliver interventions aimed at improving health and survival of both mother and the infant. Multiple individual studies and national surveys have assessed antenatal care utilization at a single point in time across different countries, but {ANC} trends have not often been studied in rural areas of low-middle income countries ({LMICs}). The objective of this analysis was to study the trends of antenatal care use in {LMICs} over a seven-year period. Methods: Using a prospective maternal and newborn health registry study, we analyzed data collected from 2011 to 2017 across five countries (Guatemala, India [2 sites], Kenya, Pakistan, and Zambia). Utilization of any {ANC} along with use of select services, including vitamins/iron, tetanus toxoid vaccine and {HIV} testing, were assessed. We used a generalized linear regression model to examine the trends of women receiving at least one and at least four antenatal care visits by site and year, controlling for maternal age, education and parity. Results: Between January 2011 and December 2017, 313,663 women were enrolled and included in the analysis. For all six sites, a high proportion of women received at least one {ANC} visit across this period. Over the years, there was a trend for an increasing proportion of women receiving at least one and at least four {ANC} visits in all sites, except for Guatemala where a decline in {ANC} was observed. Regarding utilization of specific services, in India almost 100\% of women reported receiving tetanus toxoid vaccine, vitamins/iron supplementation and {HIV} testing services for all study years. In Kenya, a small increase in the proportion of women receiving tetanus toxoid vaccine was observed, while for Zambia, tetanus toxoid use declined from 97\% in 2011 to 89\% in 2017. No trends for tetanus toxoid use were observed for Pakistan and Guatemala. Across all countries an increasing trend was observed for use of vitamins/iron and {HIV} testing. However, {HIV} testing remained very low ({\textless}0.1\%) for Pakistan. Conclusion: In a range of {LMICs}, from 2011 to 2017 nearly all women received at least one {ANC} visit, and a significant increase in the proportion of women who received at least four {ANC} visits was observed across all sites except Guatemala. Moreover, there were variations regarding the utilization of preventive care services across all sites except for India where rates were generally high. More research is required to understand the quality and influences of {ANC}.},

In these countries, where access to emergency obstetric services is limited, antenatal care ({ANC}) utilization offers improved maternal health and birth outcomes. However, evidence for this is scanty and mixed. We explored the association between attendance for {ANC} and survival of neonates in 57 {LMICs}.Employing standardized protocols to ensure comparison across countries, we used nationally representative cross-sectional data from 57 {LMICs} (N = 464 728) to investigate the association between {ANC} visits and neonatal mortality. Cox proportional hazards multivariable regression models and meta-regression analysis were used to analyse pooled data from the countries. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to describe the patterns of neonatal survival in each region.After adjusting for potential confounding factors, we found 55\% lower risk of neonatal mortality [hazard ratio ({HR}) 0.45, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.42–0.48] among women who met both {WHO} recommendations for {ANC} (first visit within the first trimester and at least four visits during pregnancy) in pooled analysis. Furthermore, meta-analysis of country-level risk shows 32\% lower risk of neonatal mortality ({HR} 0.68, 95\% {CI} 0.61–0.75) among those who met at least one {WHO} recommendation. In addition, {ANC} attendance was associated with lower neonatal mortality in all the regions except in the Middle East and North Africa.{ANC} attendance is protective against neonatal mortality in the {LMICs} studied, although differences exist across countries and regions. Increasing {ANC} visits, along with other known effective interventions, can improve neonatal survival in these countries.},

Methods Data on a sample of ever-married women from India Demographic and Health survey 2005–06 was used. Mothers of children aged 0–59 months were asked about child’s illnesses and type of health facilities where treatment was given during 15 days prior to the survey date. Type of health facilities were grouped as informal provider, public provider and private provider. Factors associated with utilization of health services for diarrhea and fever/cough was assessed according to Andersen’s health behavior model. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were done considering sampling weights for complex sampling design. Results A total of 48,679 of ever-married women reported that 9.1\% 14.8\% and 17.67\% of their children had diarrhea, fever and cough respectively. Nearly one-third of the children with diarrhea and fever/cough did not receive any treatment. Two-thirds of children who received treatment were from private health care providers ({HCPs}). Among predisposing factors, children aged 1–2 years and those born at health facility (public/private) were more likely to be taken to any type of {HCP} during illness. Among enabling factors, as compared to poorer household, wealthier households were 2.5 times more likely to choose private {HCPs} for any illness. Children in rural areas were likely to be taken to any type of {HCP} for diarrhea but rural children were less likely to utilize private {HCP} for fever/cough. ‘Need’ factors i.e. children having severe symptoms were 2–3 times more likely to be taken to any type of {HCP}. Conclusion Private {HCPs} were preferred for treatment of childhood illnesses. Involvement of private {HCPs} may be considered while planning child health programs.

	abstract = {A number of primary studies and systematic reviews focused on the contribution of community health workers ({CHWs}) in the delivery of essential health services. In many countries, a cadre of informal health workers also provide services on a volunteer basis [community health volunteers ({CHV})], but there has been no synthesis of studies investigating their role and potential contribution across a range of health conditions; most existing studies are narrowly focused on a single condition. As this cadre grows in importance, there is a need to examine the evidence on whether and how {CHVs} can improve access to and use of essential health services in low- and middle-income countries ({LMICs}). We report an umbrella review of systematic reviews, searching {PubMed}, the Cochrane library, the database of abstracts of reviews of effects ({DARE}), {EMBASE}, {ProQuest} dissertation and theses, the Campbell library and {DOPHER}. We considered a review as ‘systematic’ if it had an explicit search strategy with qualitative or quantitative summaries of data. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute ({JBI}) critical appraisal assessment checklist to assess methodological quality. A data extraction format prepared a priori was used to extract data. Findings were synthesized narratively. Of 422 records initially found by the search strategy, we identified 39 systematic reviews eligible for inclusion. Most concluded that services provided by {CHVs} were not inferior to those provided by other health workers, and sometimes better. However, {CHVs} performed less well in more complex tasks such as diagnosis and counselling. Their performance could be strengthened by regular supportive supervision, in-service training and adequate logistical support, as well as a high level of community ownership. The use of {CHVs} in the delivery of selected health services for population groups with limited access, particularly in {LMICs}, appears promising. However, success requires careful implementation, strong policy backing and continual support by their managers.},

	abstract = {Background Quality care in health facilities is critical for a sustainable health insurance system because of its influence on clients’ decisions to participate in health insurance and utilize health services. Exploration of the different dimensions of healthcare quality and their associations will help determine more effective quality improvement interventions and health insurance sustainability strategies, especially in resource constrained countries in Africa where universal access to good quality care remains a challenge. Purpose To examine the differences in perceptions of clients and health staff on quality healthcare and determine if these perceptions are associated with technical quality proxies in health facilities. Implications of the findings for a sustainable National Health Insurance Scheme ({NHIS}) in Ghana are also discussed. Methods This is a cross-sectional study in two southern regions in Ghana involving 64 primary health facilities: 1,903 households and 324 health staff. Data collection lasted from March to June, 2012. A Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was performed to determine differences in client and health staff perceptions of quality healthcare. Spearman’s rank correlation test was used to ascertain associations between perceived and technical quality care proxies in health facilities, and ordered logistic regression employed to predict the determinants of client and staff-perceived quality healthcare. Results Negative association was found between technical quality and client-perceived quality care (coef. = -0.0991, p{\textless}0.0001). Significant staff-client perception differences were found in all healthcare quality proxies, suggesting some level of unbalanced commitment to quality improvement and potential information asymmetry between clients and service providers. Overall, the findings suggest that increased efforts towards technical quality care alone will not necessarily translate into better client-perceived quality care and willingness to utilize health services in {NHIS}-accredited health facilities. Conclusion There is the need to intensify client education and balanced commitment to technical and perceived quality improvement efforts. This will help enhance client confidence in Ghana’s healthcare system, stimulate active participation in the national health insurance, increase healthcare utilization and ultimately improve public health outcomes.},

	abstract = {This paper defines quality of health care. We suggest that there are two principal dimensions of quality of care for individual patients; access and effectiveness. In essence, do users get the care they need, and is the care effective when they get it? Within effectiveness, we define two key components — effectiveness of clinical care and effectiveness of inter-personal care. These elements are discussed in terms of the structure of the health care system, processes of care, and outcomes resulting from care. The framework relates quality of care to individual patients and we suggest that quality of care is a concept that is at its most meaningful when applied to the individual user of health care. However, care for individuals must placed in the context of providing health care for populations which introduces additional notions of equity and efficiency. We show how this framework can be of practical value by applying the concepts to a set of quality indicators contained within the {UK} National Performance Assessment Framework and to a set of widely used indicators in the {US} ({HEDIS}). In so doing we emphasise the differences between {US} and {UK} measures of quality. Using a conceptual framework to describe the totality of quality of care shows which aspects of care any set of quality indicators actually includes and measures and, and which are not included.},

However, concerns have been raised about the reliability of responses in such surveys: for example, ‘courtesy bias’ may lead clients, especially if interviewed upon exiting clinics, to provide misleadingly favorable responses. This study investigates this and other issues using unusual data from Madagascar in which identical questions about satisfaction with local health care centers were asked in user exit surveys and in a population-based household survey, the latter being less contaminated by courtesy bias as well as changes in provider behavior in response to being observed. The findings suggest that reported satisfaction in exit surveys is biased strongly upward for subjective questions regarding (for example) treatment by staff and consultation quality, but not for relatively objective questions about facility condition and supplies. The surveys do provide useful information on the determinants of consumer satisfaction with various dimensions of provider quality. Still, to obtain reliable estimates of consumer perceptions of health service quality, household-based sampling is strongly preferred.},

There is a policy of free primary healthcare for all in {SA}, as outlined in the Constitution and the National Health Act, but its interpretation is less inclusive within implementation guidelines and practice. As a result, non-nationals face access challenges, and healthcare responses have engaged with migration to a limited extent only.

To maximise positive impact and mitigate against potential negative consequences requires attention and engagement of policy-makers from health and other sectors, including public health researchers and health workers.

	abstract = {As a key principle of Primary Health Care ({PHC}) and Health Systems Reform, community participation has a prominent place in the current global dialogue. Participation is not only promoted in the context of provision and utilization of health services. Advocates also highlight participation as a key factor in the wider context of the importance of social determinants of health and health as a human right. However, the evidence that directly links community participation to improved health status is not strong. Its absence continues to be a barrier for governments, funding agencies and health professionals to promote community participation. The purpose of this article is to review research seeking to link community participation with improved health status outcomes programmes. It updates a review undertaken by the author in 2009. The search includes published articles in the English language and examines the evidence of in the context of health care delivery including services and promotion where health professionals have defined the community’s role. The results show that in most studies community participation is defined as the intervention seeking to identify a direct causal link between participation and improved health status modeled on Randomized Control studies ({RCT}). The majority of studies show it is not possible to examine the link because there is no standard definition of ‘community’ and ‘participation’. Where links are found, they are situation-specific and are unpredictable and not generalizable. In the discussion, an alternative research framework is proposed arguing that community participation is better understood as a process. Once concrete interventions are identified (i.e. improved birth outcomes) then the processes producing improved health status outcomes can be examined. These processes may include and can lead to community uptake, ownership and sustainability for health improvements. However, more research is needed to ensure their validity.},

	abstract = {Reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health ({RMNCAH}) indicators, such as the maternal mortality ratio, often serve as a litmus test for health system performance, because women’s and children’s health lies at the core of any health system.1 The health and survival of women and children does not depend on a single intervention, but on packages of interventions delivered at all levels of the health system. Mapping and tracking {RMNCAH} therefore captures changes in wider health system performance. But mapping has traditionally been the domain of disease-specific tracking, providing useful, but limited snapshots of progress embedded in vertical intervention mechanisms. Although disease-specific spatial mapping and research are effective ways to identify geographic inequities and to inform service provision, geographic and spatial analyses of {RMNCAH} have the potential to provide a broader perspective. But such analyses, especially for routine {RMNCAH} care provision, have been underused despite their potential to inform programmes and policies in low/middle-income countries. This commentary also argues that visualisation of {RMNCAH} data provides a potent social accountability and decision-making tool. Given the topic’s importance, a supplement on the use of geographic information systems ({GIS}) in {RMNCAH} is long overdue.

Most geospatial studies in {RMNCAH} start with the geographical placement of facilities and facility staff—the fundamental infrastructure of all health systems—and the location of communities. Clearly, tackling frequently occurring birth and childhood health emergencies requires accessible, person-centred systems located near the client.2 Previous geospatial studies that have focused on determining access or distance to facilities have benefited from analytical techniques developed in the environmental science and physical geography fields. Few previous studies consider realistic travel over terrain or health facility ‘bypassing,’ where healthcare-seeking clients choose not to use their closest facility. This supplement thus breaks new ground by demonstrating that geospatial analysis has …},

	abstract = {Aim:
              A large number of studies have addressed the detection of patient satisfaction determinants, and the results are still inconclusive. Furthermore, it is known that contradicting evidence exists across patient satisfaction studies. This article is the second part of a two-part series of research with a goal to review a current conceptual framework of patient satisfaction for further operationalisation procedures. The aim of this work was to systematically identify and review evidence regarding determinants of patient satisfaction between 1980 and 2014, and to seek the reasons for contradicting results in relationships between determinants and patient satisfaction in the literature to design a further robust measurement system for patient satisfaction.
            
            
              Method:
              This systematic review followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis ({PRISMA}) statement. The search was conducted in {PubMed}, {CINAHL}, and Scopus in October 2014. Studies published in full in peer reviewed journals between January 1980 and August 2014 and in the English language were included. We included 109 articles for the synthesis.
            
            
              Results:
              We found several number of determinants of patient satisfaction investigated in a wide diversity of studies. However, study results were varied due to no globally accepted formulation of patient satisfaction and measurement system.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Health care service quality indicators were the most influential determinants of patient satisfaction across the studies. Among them, health providers’ interpersonal care quality was the essential determinant of patient satisfaction. Sociodemographic characteristics were the most varied in the review. The strength and directions of associations with patient satisfaction were found inconsistent. Therefore, person-related characteristics should be considered to be the potential determinants and confounders simultaneously. The selected studies were not able to show all potential characteristics which may have had effects on satisfaction. There is a need for more studies on how cultural, behavioural, and socio-demographic differences affect patient satisfaction, using a standardised questionnaire.},

	abstract = {Introduction Satisfaction is the result of a process; to assess satisfaction, the care recipients’ experiences of the services received should be understood and efforts should be made to understand how these experiences have formed that satisfaction. The aim of this study was to understand the processes of satisfaction with nursing care in parents of hospitalized children. Materials and Methods The present grounded theory study was conducted on 25 participants selected through theoretical sampling and examined using in-depth semi-structured interviews. Interviews, promptly transcribed after the end of each the interview. The data obtained were analyzed concurrently with their collection based on Strauss and Corbin’s method of data analysis (1998) in three steps: open, axial and selective coding. Results
The main concern of the parents in the process of satisfaction with nursing care was the "influence of insecurity". The parents were put in an unstable context of care, upon which they resorted to the "prudent gaining of certainty" strategy. In this process, intrapersonal and extra personal triggers acted as facilitators and personal weaknesses as inhibitors, and "fluctuating trust" was the result of the process. Conclusions Gaining certainty plays an important role in the formation of satisfaction with nursing care, and the particular characteristics of the context of care have a crucial effect on the intensity or weakness of the developed trust; eventually, the developed certainty results in trust in the received care, which further emphasizes the importance of nurses' efforts for facilitating an ascertaining care.

	abstract = {In this review of the theoretical and empirical work on patient satisfaction with care, the most consistent finding is that the characteristics of providers or organizations that result in more "personal" care are associated with higher levels of satisfaction. Some studies suggest that more personal care will result in better communication and more patient involvement, and hence better quality of care, but the data on these issues are weak and inconsistent. Further research is needed to measure specific aspects of medical care and the ways in which patient reports can complement other sources of information about quality. In addition, more research on the determinants of satisfaction and the relationship between quality and satisfaction among hospitalized patients is recommended.},

	abstract = {Geolocation error in sampling {LiDAR} measurements of forest structure can compromise forest attribute estimates and degrade integration with georeferenced field measurements or other remotely sensed data. Integrating sampling {LiDAR} with other georeferenced data is especially problematic when geolocation error is not well quantified. Here, we propose and illustrate a model that uses high spatial accuracy airborne laser scanning ({ALS}) data from {NASA} Goddard's {LiDAR}, Hyperspectral \& Thermal Imager (G-{LiHT}) to quantify and correct geolocation error in {NASA}'s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation ({GEDI}) spaceborne sampling {LiDAR}. The model accommodates multiple canopy height metrics derived from a simulated {GEDI} footprint kernel of known functional form using spatially coincident G-{LiHT}, and incorporates both additive and multiplicative mapping between the canopy height metrics generated from both {LiDAR} datasets. A Bayesian implementation provides probabilistic uncertainty quantification in both parameter and geolocation error estimates. Results show an estimated maximum a posteriori ({MAP}) systematic geolocation error (i.e., across all {GEDI} footprints) of 9.62 m in the southwest direction. In addition, estimated {MAP} actual geolocation errors (i.e., within {GEDI} footprints) were highly variable with results showing a {\textasciitilde}0.15 probability the true {GEDI} footprint center is within 10 m and a {\textasciitilde}0.45 probability the true {GEDI} footprint center is within 20 m. Estimating and correcting geolocation error via the modeling approach outlined here can help inform subsequent efforts to integrate sampling {LiDAR}, like {GEDI}, with other georeferenced data.},

	abstract = {Little research exists that examines the causal relationship between patient satisfaction and the use of health services. This study of a representative sample of low income families suggests that a relationship does exist. Furthermore, results reported indicate it is bidirectional and reciprocal in nature, and that it is highly related to the provider from which patients seek care. Analysis according to the five major area clinics that were main sources of medical care for an upstate New York community (two {HMOs}, two hospital-affiliated teaching clinics, and one continuity-of-care clinic) revealed that, in some providers, the association between use and satisfaction is positive, in others negative. Further evidence for a "patient provider" interaction hypothesis was found, suggesting that background characteristics, including health status and race, are related to use and satisfaction in different ways in different clinics. The findings provide evidence for the existence of a causal relationship between use and satisfaction, which is dependent on the context in which medical care is given, and also suggest structural characteristics that might be responsible for these effects. A final conceptual model of satisfaction is offered, permitting reciprocal causation with use and satisfaction with emphasis on patient provider interactions, and this model provides an identification of short- and long-term processes. Progress in this area might require a shift in perspective upward toward structural and systems variables or a shift downward toward "microanalytic" processes, which detail patient-provider interactions.},

	shorttitle = {Trap of weights},
	abstract = {Background: Geographic weights are vital in the floating catchment area ({FCA}) method of accessibility measurements due to their simulation of spatial barriers in various ways. When modelling population demand, geographical weights with different distance decay coefficients can reflect diverse distance tolerances in facility utilization and could lead to erratic accessibility results. Quantifying accessibility as the sum of weighted supply-demand ratios can alleviate the distance decay coefficient's influence and generate stable geographic patterns. However, the effects of weighted ratios on different {FCA} models and resources have not been investigated., 
Methods: To identify impacts of weighted ratios on various {FCA} variants, this study contrasted the accessibility calculated from the sum of ratios (access) and the sum of weighted ratios (access ratios) within three prevalent {FCA} models: enhanced two-step {FCA} (E2SFCA), modified two-step {FCA} (M2SFCA), and three-step {FCA} (3SFCA). In addition, the accessibilities of various resources evaluate the stability of the weighted ratios' effect. This study therefore examined the accessibilities to primary schools, job opportunities, and major hospitals in Shanghai. Shanghai is a case study that provides lessons on using big data to measure accessibility in metropolitan areas., 
Results: Geographic weights can not only mitigate the impact of the distance decay coefficients, but can also eliminate model features, which reduces the performance of the M2SFCA's supply decay and the 3SFCA's population demand adjustment in accessibility results. Moreover, weighted ratios tend to overestimate accessibility in marginal communities that lie within fewer catchments, regardless of the resource type. This tendency can lead to an epistemological trap that creates an inaccurate and counter-intuitive perception of resource distribution in a given area., 
Conclusions: The results identify a gap between the methodological logic and the empirical perception in accessibility measurements. This study concludes that the use of geographic weights needs to be cautious and epistemologically consistent.},

It has long been recognized that access to {SRH} services is essential to positive health outcomes, especially in rural areas of developing countries, where long distances as well as poor transportation conditions, can be potential barriers to health care acquisition. Improving accessibility of health services for target populations is therefore critical for specialized healthcare programs. Thus, understanding and evaluation of current access to health care is crucial. Combining spatial information using geographical information system ({GIS}) with population survey data, this study details a gravity model-based method to measure and evaluate access to {SRH} services in rural Mozambique, and analyzes potential geographic access to such services, using family planning as an example. Access is found to be a significant factor in reported behavior, superior to traditional distance-based indicators. Spatial disparities in geographic access among different population groups also appear to exist, likely affecting overall program success.},

The framework provides guidance for more effective assessment of current strengths and gaps in {PHC} delivery through a core set of 25 key indicators (“Vital Signs”). Emerging best practices that foster high-performing {PHC} system development are being codified and shared around low- and high-income countries.

This research aimed to compare definitions of care quality across research articles that incorporate data from Service Provision Assessment ({SPA}) surveys. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines, we used a keyword search in {PubMed}. Each author reviewed abstracts, then full texts, for inclusion criteria, and peer-reviewed publications of empirical analysis using {SPA} data. The search yielded 3,250 unique abstracts, and 34 publications were included in the final analysis. We extracted details on the {SPA} dataset(s) used, theoretical framework applied, and how care quality was operationalized. The 34 included articles used {SPA} data from 14 surveys in nine countries (all in sub-Saharan Africa plus Haiti). One-third of these articles (n = 13) included no theoretical or conceptual framework for care quality. Among those articles referencing a framework, the most common was the Donabedian model (n = 7). Studies operationalized quality constructs in extremely different ways. Few articles included outcomes as a quality construct, and the operationalization of structure varied widely. A key asset of {SPA} surveys, owing to the standardized structure and use of harmonized data collection instruments, is the potential for cross-survey comparisons. However, this is limited by the lack of a common framework for measuring and reporting quality in the existing literature using {SPA} data. Service Provision Assessment surveys offer unique and valuable insights, and a common framework and approach would substantially strengthen the body of knowledge on quality of care in low-resource settings.},

To overcome this problem, a cluster analysis is performed to create a service environment variable, which reflects differences in service availability, population size and rurality. Utilization of health services is then modelled as a logistic regression equation where the independent variables are age, sex, service environment and income to test the Birch and Abelson argument. This argument is then extended by controlling for age, health and income status. Based on the modelling results, the importance of geography to access and utilization is assessed.},

The proposed conceptual model recognizes access as the outcome of a process involving the interplay between the characteristics of the health care service system and of potential users in a specified area, and moderated by health care related public policy and planning efforts. An elaborate typology of access, incorporating four pairs of access dimensions, is also derived. This atomization of the concept allows us to focus on specific aspects of the access to health care problem, and to develop precise outcome indicators of health system performance for evaluative purposes. Further, it enables the access concept and its pertinent dimensions to be put into proper perspective when assessing the health care access situation in a specific national or regional context. The relevance of the proposed access model and the typology to health care planning in general, and to spatial planning of health care service systems in particular; is also discussed.},

However, despite the many advantages of 2SFCA, the problems associated with using fixed catchment sizes have not been satisfactorily addressed. We propose a new method to dynamically determine physician and population catchment sizes by incrementally increasing the catchment until a base population and a physician-to-population ratio are met. Preliminary application to the ten-county region in northern Illinois has demonstrated that the new method is effective in determining the appropriate catchment sizes across the urban to suburban/rural continuum and has revealed greater detail in spatial variation of accessibility compared to results using fixed catchment sizes.},

Nowhere is the worldwide shortage of health professionals more pronounced than in rural areas of developing countries. Sub-Saharan Africa ({SSA}) includes a disproportionately large number of developing countries; therefore, this article explores {SSA} in depth as an example. Using the conceptual framework of access to primary health care, sustainable rural health service models, rural health workforce supply, and policy implications, this article presents a review of the academic and gray literature as the basis for recommendations designed to achieve greater health equity. An alternative international standard for health professional education is recommended. Decision makers should draw upon the expertise of communities to identify community-specific health priorities and should build capacity to enable the recruitment and training of local students from underserviced areas to deliver quality health care in rural community settings.},

	abstract = {Despite the huge differences between developing and developed countries, access is the major issue in rural health around the world. Even in the countries where the majority of the population lives in rural areas, the resources are concentrated in the cities. All countries have difficulties with transport and communication, and they all face the challenge of shortages of doctors and other health professionals in rural and remote areas. Many rural people are caught in the poverty– ill health–low productivity downward spiral, particularly in developing countries. Since 1992, {WONCA}, the World Organization of Family Doctors, has developed a specific focus on rural health through the {WONCA} Working Party on Rural Practice. This Working Party has drawn national and international attention to major rural health issues through World Rural Health Conferences and {WONCA} Rural Policies. The World Health Organization ({WHO}) has broadened its focus beyond public health to partnership with family practice, initially through a landmark {WHO}–{WONCA} Invitational Conference in Canada. From this has developed the Memorandum of Agreement between {WONCA} and {WHO} which emphasizes the important role of family practitioners in primary health care and also includes the Rural Health Initiative. In April 2002, {WHO} and {WONCA} held a major {WHO}–{WONCA} Invitational Conference on Rural Health. This conference addressed the immense challenges for improving the health of people of rural and remote areas of the world and initiated a specific action plan: The Global Initiative on Rural Health. The ‘Health for All’ vision for rural people is more likely to be achieved through joint concerted efforts of international and national bodies working together with doctors, nurses and other health workers in rural areas around the world.},

We observe excess rural mortality until age 15, finding the largest differences between urban and rural sectors among 1–59-month-olds. While we cannot claim higher mortality among urban adults than those in rural areas, we find a reduced gap between the sectors over the life course and a diminishing urban advantage in adult mortality with age. This shift over the life course reflects a divergence in the epidemiologic transition between the rural and urban sectors.},

	abstract = {Equity in health outcomes for rural and remote populations in low- and middle-income countries ({LMICs}) is limited by a range of socio-economic, cultural and environmental determinants of health. Health professional education that is sensitive to local population needs and that attends to all elements of the rural pathway is vital to increase the proportion of the health workforce that practices in underserved rural and remote areas. The Training for Health Equity Network ({THEnet}) is a community-of-practice of 13 health professional education institutions with a focus on delivering socially accountable education to produce a fit-for-purpose health workforce. The {THEnet} Graduate Outcome Study is an international prospective cohort study with more than 6,000 learners from nine health professional schools in seven countries (including four {LMICs}; the Philippines, Sudan, South Africa and Nepal). Surveys of learners are administered at entry to and exit from medical school, and at years 1, 4, 7, and 10 thereafter. The association of learners' intention to practice in rural and other underserved areas, and a range of individual and institutional level variables at two time points—entry to and exit from the medical program, are examined and compared between country income settings. These findings are then triangulated with a sociocultural exploration of the structural relationships between educational and health service delivery ministries in each setting, status of postgraduate training for primary care, and current policy settings. This analysis confirmed the association of rural background with intention to practice in rural areas at both entry and exit. Intention to work abroad was greater for learners at entry, with a significant shift to an intention to work in-country for learners with entry and exit data. Learners at exit were more likely to intend a career in generalist disciplines than those at entry however lack of health policy and unclear career pathways limits the effectiveness of educational strategies in {LMICs}. This multi-national study of learners from medical schools with a social accountability mandate confirms that it is possible to produce a health workforce with a strong intent to practice in rural areas through attention to all aspects of the rural pathway.},

In addition to health systems, social systems, such as schools, communities, families, and digital platforms, can be used to promote health. We did a targeted literature review of how well health and social systems are meeting the needs of children in {LMICs} using the framework of The Lancet Global Health Commission on high-quality health systems and we reviewed evidence for structural reforms in health and social sectors. We found that quality of services for children is substandard across both health and social systems. Health systems have deficits in care competence (eg, diagnosis and management), system competence (eg, timeliness, continuity, and referral), user experience (eg, respect and usability), service provision for common and serious conditions (eg, cancer, trauma, and mental health), and service offerings for adolescents. Education and social services for child health are limited by low funding and poor coordination with other sectors. Structural reforms are more likely to improve service quality substantially and at scale than are micro-level efforts. Promising approaches include governing for quality (eg, leadership, expert management, and learning systems), redesigning service delivery to maximise outcomes, and empowering families to better care for children and to demand quality care from health and social systems. Additional research is needed on health needs across the life course, health system performance for children and families, and large-scale evaluation of promising health and social programmes.},

Unfortunately, many adolescents in Nigeria face significant barriers to accessing quality sexual and reproductive health services ({SRHS}), despite national policies promoting {SRHS} for adolescents. This paper explores the stigma influencing access to and utilization of {SRHS} among adolescents in Kaduna, Northwestern Nigeria. This qualitative study conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 adolescents and three nurses. Thematic analysis was employed for the study. The findings indicate that although the adolescents knew the importance of accessing {SRHS}, they were not inclined to utilize the services because of stigma. The stigma-related barriers to accessing {SRHS} were related to religion, community norms and the negative attitude of the community and health workers all resulting in adolescents feeling shy and ashamed to use {SRHS}. Suggestions made to address these challenges and promote access included the provision of youth-friendly services ({YFS}) that respect confidentiality and privacy and also having dedicated youth-only health clinics. Health workers emphasized the need for creating awareness in the community about adolescent {SRH} and rights and the need to improve resources to provide comprehensive youth-friendly {SRHS}. There is also the need to introduce targeted stigma reduction training programs for health workers providing youth-friendly services. The findings can inform context-specific interventions in Nigeria and better implementation of the country’s policies related to adolescent {SRH}.},

	url = {https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/61539},
	abstract = {Background: Recent trends in maternal health in low- and middle-income countries ({LMIC}) show increasing health service utilization without anticipated improvement in outcomes, leading some to question the health care quality. Programs seeking to improve health care quality frequently use the Donabedian quality of care framework as a guide. This study examined the associations among the different dimensions – structure, process, and outcome – of the Donabedian quality of care framework in the Malawi maternal health care context.
Methods: Using data from the 2013 Malawi Service Provision Assessment ({SPA}), two measures of antenatal and labor and delivery (L\&D) care structure – infrastructure and human resources – and two measures of process – technical and interpersonal – quality were constructed. Spearman’s correlations were used to estimate associations between structure and process elements in antenatal (N=400) and L\&D facilities (N=179). At facilities with observation data from both services (N=149), associations of quality elements between services were assessed. Multilevel path analysis was used estimate direct and indirect effects of structure and process quality elements on outcomes; first patient satisfaction among all antenatal patients (N=2000) and facilities (n=400), and second intention to deliver at the same facility among antenatal patients at facilities which offered both services (N=1817, n=360).
Results: Structure and process quality was poor in both antenatal and L\&D care. Structural quality was positively associated with technical process quality. Neither element of structural quality was associated with interpersonal process quality. Technical, but not interpersonal, process quality was correlated in the two service areas. Better interpersonal process quality, hospitals, private health facilities, as well as lower patient education were significantly associated with higher patient satisfaction. Hospitals, lower patient education, and higher parity were significantly and directly associated with increased intention to deliver at the same facility. Infrastructure had a significantly negative indirect effect on intention to deliver at the same facility through technical process.
Conclusion: These data do not support the Donabedian quality of care framework. This study highlights the need to focus on quality of maternal health care in Malawi, as well as the need to better understand how measurement of quality of care influences associations with patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {Forty years ago, the 134 national government members of the {WHO} signed the Alma Ata Declaration. The Declaration made Primary Health Care ({PHC}) the official health policy of all members countries. Emerging from the conference was the consensus that health was a human right based on the principles of equity and community participation. Alma Ata broadened the perception of health beyond doctors and hospitals to social determinants and social justice. In the following years implementing this policy confronted many challenges. These included: (1) whether {PHC} should focus on vertical disease programmes where interventions had the most possibility of success or on comprehensive programmes that addressed social, economic and political factors that influenced health improvements; (2) whether primary care and {PHC} are interchangeable approaches to health improvements; (3) how equity and community participation for health improvements would be institutionalised; and (4) how financing for {PHC} would be possible. Experiences in implementation over the last 40 years provide evidence of how these challenges have been met and what succeeded and what had failed. Lessons from these experiences include the need to understand {PHC} as a process rather than a blueprint, to understand the process must consider context, culture, politics, economics and social concerns, and therefore, to recognise the process is complex. {PHC} needs to be examined within evaluation frameworks that address complexity. Recent developments in monitoring and evaluation have begun to respond to this need. They include realist evaluation and implementation research.},

	shorttitle = {The winding road to health},
	abstract = {Background Geographical accessibility to healthcare is an important component of infectious disease dynamics. Timely access to health facilities can prevent disease progression and enables disease notification through surveillance systems. The importance of accounting for physical accessibility in response to infectious diseases is increasingly recognized. Yet, there is no comprehensive review of the literature available on infectious diseases in relation to geographical accessibility to care. Therefore, we aimed at evaluating the current state of knowledge on the effect of geographical accessibility to health care on infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries. Methods and findings A search strategy was developed and conducted on Web of Science and {PubMed} on 4 March 2019. New publications were checked until May 28, 2020. All publication dates were eligible. Data was charted into a tabular format and descriptive data analyses were carried out to identify geographical regions, infectious diseases, and measures of physical accessibility among other factors. Search queries in {PubMed} and Web of Science yielded 560 unique publications. After title and abstract screening 99 articles were read in full detail, from which 64 articles were selected, including 10 manually. Results of the included publications could be broadly categorized into three groups: (1) decreased spatial accessibility to health care was associated with a higher infectious disease burden, (2) decreased accessibility was associated to lower disease reporting, minimizing true understanding of disease distribution, and (3) the occurrence of an infectious disease outbreak negatively impacted health care accessibility in affected regions. In the majority of studies, poor geographical accessibility to health care was associated with higher disease incidence, more severe health outcomes, higher mortality, and lower disease reporting. No difference was seen between countries or infectious diseases. Conclusions Currently, policy-makers and scientists rely on data collected through passive surveillance systems, introducing uncertainty on disease estimates for remote communities. Our results highlight the need for increasing integration of geographical accessibility measures in disease risk modelling, allowing more realistic disease estimates and enhancing our understanding of true disease burden. Additionally, disease risk estimates could be used in turn to optimize the allocation of health services in the prevention and detection of infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {Existing definitions and measurement approaches of quality of health care often fail to address the complexities involved in understanding quality of care. It is perceptions of quality, rather than clinical indicators of quality, that drive service utilization and are essential to increasing demand. Here we reflect on the nature of quality, how perceptions of quality influence health systems and what such perceptions indicate about measurement of quality within health systems. We discuss six specific challenges related to the conceptualization and measurement of the quality of care: perceived quality as a driver of service utilization; quality as a concept shaped over time through experience; responsiveness as a key attribute of quality; the role of management and other so-called upstream factors; quality as a social construct co-produced by families, individuals, networks and providers; and the implications of our observations for measurement. Within the communities and societies where care is provided, quality of care cannot be understood outside social norms, relationships, trust and values. We need to improve not only technical quality but also acceptability, responsiveness and levels of patient–provider trust. Measurement approaches need to be reconsidered. An improved understanding of all the attributes of quality in health systems and their interrelationships could support the expansion of access to essential health interventions.},

	abstract = {Delivery in a health facility is a key strategy for reducing maternal and neonatal mortality, yet increasing use of facilities has not consistently translated into reduced mortality in low- and middle-income countries. In such countries, many deliveries occur at primary care facilities, where the quality of care is poor. We modeled the geographic feasibility of service delivery redesign that shifted deliveries from primary care clinics to hospitals in six countries: Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Nepal, and Tanzania. We estimated the proportion of women within two hours of the nearest delivery facility, both currently and under redesign. Today, 83–100 percent of pregnant women in the study countries have two-hour access to a delivery facility. A policy of redesign would reduce two-hour access by at most 10 percent, ranging from 0.6 percent in Malawi to 9.9 percent in Tanzania. Relocating delivery services to hospitals would not unduly impede geographic access to care in the study countries. This policy should be considered in low- and middle-income countries, as it may be an effective approach to reducing maternal and newborn deaths.},

	shorttitle = {Antenatal care and skilled birth attendance in Bangladesh are influenced by female education and family affordability},
	abstract = {Objectives
Antenatal care ({ANC}) during pregnancy and skilled birth attendance ({SBA}) during delivery are important policy concerns to reduce maternal deaths. Bangladesh is one of the developing countries which has made remarkable progress in both services during the last couple of decades by improving the {SBA} service rate from 16\% in 2004 to 42.1\% in 2014. However, this rate remains below the targeted level (50\%) of the Health Population and Nutrition Sector Development Program set by the Ministry of the Health and Family Welfare of Bangladesh. This article explored the sociodemographic factors associated with the {ANC} and {SBA} service attainment. Furthermore, the possible implication of using {ANC} on {SBA} was also investigated.
Study design
The study followed a cross-sectional design using the Bangladesh demographic and health survey 2014, with a sample of size 4603 women with at least one live birth 3 years preceding the survey.
Methods
Following a bivariate analysis, linear mixed-effect models were used to assess the relationship between sociodemographic factors and the outcome indicators ({ANC} and {SBA}). Finally, the association between {SBA} and {ANC} was evaluated through another mixed-effect model.
Results
Wealth index, participation in household decisions, and partner's and respondent's education were significant predictors of {ANC}; whereas, residence, age at first birth, wealth index, working status, participation in household decisions, and partner and respondent's education were significant for {SBA}. Female education and household affordability were the strongest predictors for both {ANC} and {SBA}. {ANC} showed significant association with {SBA} as women accessing essential {ANC} during delivery seemed to be 4 times more likely (95\% confidence interval: 3.05–5.93) to avail {SBA} services.
Conclusions
Overall, four factors were significant: residence, wealth index, education, and {ANC} access. Women residing in urban areas, having higher financial solvency, completing higher education, and accessing {ANC} by skilled personnel were more likely to receive {SBA} at delivery than their counterparts. Accessibility to skilled care during pregnancy leads to increased professional care during delivery. Thus, policies to encourage women and heads of families to seek skilled care during pregnancy would be beneficial to reach the maternal healthcare targets of Bangladesh.},

We argue that the development of a highly pluralistic health system environment, defined by the participation of a multiplicity of different stakeholders and agents and by ad hoc, diffused forms of management has contributed to these outcomes by creating conditions for rapid change. We use a combination of data from official sources, research studies, case studies of specific innovations, and in-depth knowledge from our own long-term engagement with health sector issues in Bangladesh to lay out a conceptual framework for understanding pluralism and its outcomes. Although we argue that pluralism has had positive effects in terms of stimulating change and innovation, we also note its association with poor health systems governance and regulation, resulting in endemic problems such as overuse and misuse of drugs. Pluralism therefore requires active management that acknowledges and works with its polycentric nature. We identify four key areas where this management is needed: participatory governance, accountability and regulation, information systems, and capacity development. This approach challenges some mainstream frameworks for managing health systems, such as the building blocks approach of the {WHO} Health Systems Framework. However, as pluralism increasingly defines the nature and the challenge of 21st century health systems, the experience of Bangladesh is relevant to many countries across the world.},

Bangladesh's inability to provide quality healthcare services, along with issues pertaining to limited resources, absenteeism, poor governance, and lack of accountability in its public healthcare system have created wide gaps that are increasingly being filled by the private sector. This has been fuelled by the state's investment in medical education and training of public sector physicians while simultaneously permitting them to practice privately, as well as the provision of grants and subsidies. The growth of this sector has limited benefits for the improvement of people's health.

	abstract = {Based on a brief examination of private sector healthcare in Bangladesh, this article examines two questions: (a) the compatibility of social justice and the right to healthcare with the private provision of healthcare, (b) the implication of the private sector’s role in realising social justice and the right to healthcare. It is based on an extensive review of both published and unpublished documents including journal articles, government reports, policy and planning documents, as well as reports of United Nations, the World Health Organisation and the World Bank. Different search engines and databases were used to collect the documents. Thematic data analysis techniques were used in developing the text. Private provision of healthcare services raises concerns about social justice and the right to healthcare. This sector to some extent is unable to fulfil its obligation to realise social justice and the right to healthcare in the provision of healthcare. An expanding private sector role creates complexities in promoting and protecting the right to health and social justice. The study emphasised the role of the government to engage its political will and make changes in policy and governance to engage private sector in realising right to healthcare and social justice.},

This study explores the existing health policy environment and current activities to further the progress towards Universal Health Coverage ({UHC}) and the challenges faced in these endeavors. This qualitative study involved document reviews (n=22) and key informant interviews ({KII}, n=15). Thematic analysis of texts (themes: activities around {UHC}, implementation barriers, suggestions) was done using the manual coding technique. We found that Bangladesh has a comprehensive set of policies for {UHC}, e.g., a health-financing strategy and staged recommendations for pooling of funds to create a national health insurance scheme and expand financial protection for health. Progress has been made in a number of areas including the roll out of the essential package of health services for all, expansion of access to primary health care services (support by donors), and the piloting of health insurance which has been piloted in three subdistricts. Political commitment for these areas is strong. However, there are barriers pertaining to the larger policy level which includes a rigid public financing structure dating from the colonial era. While others pertain to the health sector’s implementation shortfalls including issues of human resources, political interference, monitoring, and supervision, most key informants discussed demand-side barriers too, such as sociocultural disinclination, historical mistrust, and lack of empowerment. To overcome these, several policies have been recommended, e.g., redesigning the public finance structure, improving governance and regulatory mechanism, specifying code of conduct for service providers, introducing health-financing reform, and collaborating with different sectors. To address the implementation barriers, recommendations include improving service quality, strengthening overall health systems, improving health service management, and improving monitoring and supervision. Addressing demand-side barriers, such as patient education and community empowerment, is also needed. Research and advocacy are required to address crosscutting barriers such as the lack of common understanding of {UHC}.},

	abstract = {The health system of Bangladesh relies heavily on the government or the public sector for financing and setting overall policies and service delivery mechanisms. Although the health system is faced with many intractable challenges, it seems to receive little priority in terms of national resource allocation. According to the World Health Organization ({WHO} 2010) only about 3\% of the Gross Domestic Product ({GDP}) is spent on health services. However, government expenditure on health is only about 34\% of the total health expenditure ({THE}), the rest (66\%) being out-of-pocket ({OOP}) expenses. Inequity, therefore, is a serious problem affecting the health care system. Based on a review of secondary data, the paper assesses the current challenges and opportunities of the health system in Bangladesh. The findings suggest that although the health system faces multifaceted challenges such as lack of public health facilities, scarcity of skilled workforce, inadequate financial resource allocation and political instability; Bangladesh has demonstrated much progress in achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals ({MDGs}) especially {MDG} 4 and {MDG} 5. Although the country has a growing private sector primarily providing tertiary level health care services, Bangladesh still does not have a comprehensive health policy to strengthen the entire health system. Clearly, the most crucial challenge is the absence of a dynamic and proactive stewardship able to design and enforce policies to further strengthen and enhance the overall health system. Such strong leadership could bring about meaningful and effective health system reform, which will work more efficiently for the betterment of the health of the people of Bangladesh, and would be built upon the values of equity and accountability.},

	abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the service readiness of health facilities in Bangladesh, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Nepal, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania.

Methods
Using existing data from service provision assessments of the health systems of the 10 study countries, we calculated a service readiness index for each of 8443 health facilities. This index represents the percentage availability of 50 items that the World Health Organization considers essential for providing health care. For our analysis we used 37–49 of the items on the list. We used linear regression to assess the independent explanatory power of four national and four facility-level characteristics on reported service readiness.

Findings
The mean values for the service readiness index were 77\% for the 636 hospitals and 52\% for the 7807 health centres/clinics. Deficiencies in medications and diagnostic capacity were particularly common. The readiness index varied more between hospitals and health centres/clinics in the same country than between them. There was weak correlation between national factors related to health financing and the readiness index.

Conclusion
Most health facilities in our study countries were insufficiently equipped to provide basic clinical care. If countries are to bolster health-system capacity towards achieving universal coverage, more attention needs to be given to within-country inequities.},

Their adoption by global institutions has further captured the attention of the media and policymakers around the globe, and their number of applications has surged ever since. This increase in their popularity has solicited a plethora of methodological contributions in response to the substantial criticism surrounding their underlying framework. In this paper, we put composite indicators under the spotlight, examining the wide variety of methodological approaches in existence. In this way, we offer a more recent outlook on the advances made in this field over the past years. Despite the large sequence of steps required in the construction of composite indicators, we focus particularly on two of them, namely weighting and aggregation. We find that these are where the paramount criticism appears and where a promising future lies. Finally, we review the last step of the robustness analysis that follows their construction, to which less attention has been paid despite its importance. Overall, this study aims to provide both academics and practitioners in the field of composite indices with a synopsis of the choices available alongside their recent advances.},

	abstract = {Objectives To investigate how the quality of maternal health services and travel times to health facilities affect birthing service utilisation in Eastern Region, Ghana.
Design The study is a cross-sectional spatial interaction analysis of birth service utilisation patterns. Routine birth data were spatially linked to quality care, service demand and travel time data.
Setting 131 Health facilities (public, private and faith-based) in 33 districts in Eastern Region, Ghana.
Participants Women who gave birth in health facilities in the Eastern Region, Ghana in 2017.
Outcome measures The count of women giving birth, the quality of birthing care services and the geographic coverage of birthing care services.
Results As travel time from women’s place of residence to the health facility increased up to two2 hours, the utilisation rate markedly decreased. Higher quality of maternal health services haves a larger, positive effect on utilisation rates than service proximity. The quality of maternal health services was higher in hospitals than in primary care facilities. Most women (88.6\%) travelling via mechanised transport were within two2 hours of any birthing service. The majority (56.2\%) of women were beyond the two2 -hour threshold of critical comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care ({CEmONC}) services. Few {CEmONC} services were in urban centres, disadvantaging rural populations.
Conclusions To increase birthing service utilisation in Ghana, higher quality health facilities should be located closer to women, particularly in rural areas. Beyond Ghana, routinely collected birth records could be used to understand the interaction of service proximity and quality.},

	abstract = {The quality of care provided by health systems contributes towards efforts to reach sustainable development goal 3 on health and well-being. There is growing evidence that the impact of health interventions is undermined by poor quality of care in lower-income countries. Quality of care will also be crucial to the success of universal health coverage initiatives; citizens unhappy with the quality and scope of covered services are unlikely to support public financing of health care. Moreover, an ethical impetus exists to ensure that all people, including the poorest, obtain a minimum quality standard of care that is effective for improving health. However, the measurement of quality today in low- and middle-income countries is inadequate to the task. Health information systems provide incomplete and often unreliable data, and facility surveys collect too many indicators of uncertain utility, focus on a limited number of services and are quickly out of date. Existing measures poorly capture the process of care and the patient experience. Patient outcomes that are sensitive to health-care practices, a mainstay of quality assessment in high-income countries, are rarely collected. We propose six policy recommendations to improve quality-of-care measurement and amplify its policy impact: (i) redouble efforts to improve and institutionalize civil registration and vital statistics systems; (ii) reform facility surveys and strengthen routine information systems; (iii) innovate new quality measures for low-resource contexts; (iv) get the patient perspective on quality; (v) invest in national quality data; and (vi) translate quality evidence for policy impact.},

	abstract = {Introduction Studies on the determinants of contraceptive use often consider distance to the nearest health facility offering contraception as a key explanatory variable. Women, however, may not seek contraception from the nearest facility, rather opting for a more distant facility with better quality services or to ensure greater privacy and anonymity.
Methods The dataset used include the name of facility where each women obtained contraception, measures of facility quality, and the distance between each woman’s home and 39 potential facilities she might visit. We use a conditional-multinomial logit model to estimate the determinants of her facility choice to visit and how women tradeoff travelling longer distances to use higher quality facilities.
Results Only 33\% of woman who received contraception from a health facility used their nearest facility. While the nearest facility was 1.2 km away, the average distance to facility used was 2.9 km, indicating women are willing to travel significantly longer distances for higher quality. Women prefer facilities that specialise in providing contraception, provide a large range of methods, do not suffer from stock outs and do not charge fees. Furthermore, on average, women are willing to travel an additional 2 km for a facility that offers more family planning methods, 4.7 km for a facility without one additional health service, 9 km for a facility without fees for contraception and 11 km for a facility not experiencing stock out of an additional contraception.
Conclusion Our results suggest that quality of services provided is an important driver of facility choice in addition to distance to facility.},

This study assessed the relative importance of maternal healthcare service characteristics to Bangladeshi women when choosing a health facility to deliver their babies. The study used a mixed-methods approach. Qualitative methods (expert interviews, focus group discussions) were initially employed to identify and develop the characteristics which most influence a women’s decision making when selecting a maternal health service facility. A discrete choice experiment ({DCE}) was then constructed to elicit women’s preferences. Women were shown choice scenarios representing hypothetical health facilities with nine attributes outlined. The women were then asked to rank the attributes they considered most important in the delivery of their future babies. A Hierarchical Bayes method was used to measure mean utility parameters. A total of 601 women completed the {DCE} survey. The model demonstrated significant predictive strength for actual facility choice for maternal health services. The most important attributes were the following: consistent access to a female doctor, the availability of branded drugs, respectful provider attitudes, a continuum of maternal healthcare including the availability of a C-section delivery and lesser waiting times. Attended maternal healthcare utilisation rates are low despite the access to primary healthcare facilities. Further implementation of quality improvements in maternal healthcare facilities should be prioritised.},

	abstract = {The objective of the study was to assess the factors that motivate or demotivate households to choose among the three healthcare facilities, public healthcare, private health care and traditional healthcare facilities in South Africa as revealed by Statistics South Africa . The utilisation of healthcare facilities in South Africa is such that more households prefer public healthcare facilities more than other healthcare facilities. The multinomial logit model was used, with traditional/self-medication category as the reference or baseline category. The results indicated that gender, income and access to grants were significant in influencing the probability of a household choosing a public healthcare facility, while age, income, grants, salaries/wages/commission and pensions were significant in influencing the choice of private healthcare institutions. Therefore the study recommends that due to a large portion of households that are using public health facilities compared to private and traditional facilities, the government must invest more in public healthcare facilities in South Africa.},

We relax this assumption, producing complete estimates of all between-country migration flows with genuine estimates of total global migration. We find that the total number of individuals migrating internationally has oscillated between 1.13 and 1.29\% of the global population per 5-year period since 1990. Return migration and transit migration are big parts of total migration; roughly one of four migration events is a return to an individual’s country of birth. In the most recent time period, we estimate particularly large return migration flows from the United States to Central and South America and from the Persian Gulf to south Asia.},

	abstract = {Measuring and forecasting migration patterns has important implications for understanding broader population trends, for designing policy effectively and for allocating resources. However, data on migration and mobility are often lacking, and those that do exist are not available in a timely manner. Social media data offer new opportunities to provide more up-to-date demographic estimates and to complement more traditional data sources. Facebook’s Advertising Platform, for example, is a potentially rich data source of demographic information that is regularly updated. However, Facebook’s users are not representative of the underlying population. This paper proposes a statistical framework to combine social media data with traditional survey data to produce timely ‘nowcasts’ of migrant stocks by state in the United States. The model incorporates bias adjustment of Facebook data, and a pooled principal component time series approach, to account for correlations across age, time and space. We use the model to estimate and project migrants from Mexico, India and Germany, three migrant groups with varying levels and trends of migration in the {US}. By comparing short-term projections with data from the American Community Survey, we show that the model predictions outperform alternatives that rely solely on either social media or survey data.},

New dams and water transfer schemes are being constructed, but they are both controversial and unlikely to fully satisfy demand. Alien species of trees and plants have invaded many parts of the country, taking over land from indigenous species. These alien species consume much more water than the indigenous vegetation, as well as threatening biodiversity and constituting a significant fire hazard. The Working for Water Programme, established in 1995, and working in partnership with local communities, aims to clear invasive alien species and thus increase water supply. The programme is examined in terms of its impact on environment and the livelihoods of predominantly poor rural communities. Questions are raised about the future sustainability of the programme.

	abstract = {This paper explores loss in childbearing in Malawi (miscarriages, perinatal deaths and maternal mortality) as a lens to understand accountability and health system functioning. In low-income countries, maternal and perinatal mortality reflects poor health system functioning, to be improved in part through accountability. Understanding how accountability plays out on the ground requires examination of the existing, ‘organic’ accountability relationships and mechanisms. Thematic and discourse analysis of interviews and observations illuminates vocabularies of responsibility and practices of accountability concerning loss. Women are especially held accountable for loss, by a range of social actors. They use existing ‘organic’ accountability relationships and mechanisms to manage their own interests, but arguably also to care for pregnant women, even though negative birth experiences may ensue. Instances of disrespectful care appear a by-product of the convergence of organic and orchestrated, policy-driven accountability for numeric outcomes (deaths averted) rather than process (quality of care). Moreover, in the absence of essential physical resources, providers and relatives mobilize the social resources at their disposal to keep women and babies alive. Improving quality of care requires acknowledgment that providers' actions are both systemic and situational, and embedded in local moral landscapes and uneven webs of accountability.},

Based on field research in the cobalt-rich Province of Lualaba, survey data and interviews with relevant actors, this article examines the integration of artisanal miners in corporate-led formalization projects. First, we suggest that the reliance on wageless artisanal workers in large-scale industrial operations holds important lessons for understanding the unintended effects of mining formalization.

	abstract = {The analysis of the spatiotemporal variability of wind power remains limited during the planning stage of an offshore wind farm. This study provides a framework to investigate how offshore wind power varies along the Central California Coast over diurnal and seasonal time scales, which is critical for reliability and functionality of the grid system. We find that offshore wind power in this region peaks during evening hours across all seasons and maximizes in spring and summer. The timing of peak offshore wind power production better aligns with that of peak demand across California than solar and land-based wind power production, highlighting its potential to fill the supply gap when demand is high and power production from other renewable energy sources is low. We further assess the value of offshore wind power using demand-based and wholesale market metrics. Both metrics indicate high potential value of offshore wind power over most areas in this region. Finally, we show that the estimate of power production is significantly biased when using mean wind speeds that do not account for temporal variability, leading to potentially inaccurate predictions about locations that are expected to produce the most power. These results reiterate the importance in considering spatiotemporal variability in wind power for accurately calculating the value of offshore wind development.},

We highlight the strategies that were used in Malawi which led to Malawi’s stellar performance in achieving the targets set by the {MDGs} with reference to infant and childhood mortality. The data for the analysis were obtained from Demographic and Health Surveys and from the various censuses the country has conducted. Regression analysis using district as the unit of observation reveals several important factors that have led to the commendable declines in infant mortality. Significant factors included immunisation of infants as well as increasing levels of female education and the availability of skilled birth attendants. What Malawi’s case demonstrates is that given a correct mix of strategies, even a poor country such as Malawi can meet some of the lofty targets set by the {MDGs}.},

	abstract = {Background Globally, approximately 3 million babies die annually within their first month. Access to adequate care at birth is needed to reduce newborn as well as maternal deaths. We explore the influence of distance to delivery care and of level of care on early neonatal mortality in rural Zambia and Malawi, the influence of distance (and level of care) on facility delivery, and the influence of facility delivery on early neonatal mortality. Methods and Findings National Health Facility Censuses were used to classify the level of obstetric care for 1131 Zambian and 446 Malawian delivery facilities. Straight-line distances to facilities were calculated for 3771 newborns in the 2007 Zambia {DHS} and 8842 newborns in the 2004 Malawi {DHS}. There was no association between distance to care and early neonatal mortality in Malawi ({OR} 0.97, 95\%{CI} 0.58–1.60), while in Zambia, further distance (per 10 km) was associated with lower mortality ({OR} 0.55, 95\%{CI} 0.35–0.87). The level of care provided in the closest facility showed no association with early neonatal mortality in either Malawi ({OR} 1.02, 95\%{CI} 0.90–1.16) or Zambia ({OR} 1.02, 95\%{CI} 0.82–1.26). In both countries, distance to care was strongly associated with facility use for delivery (Malawi: {OR} 0.35 per 10km, 95\%{CI} 0.26–0.46). All results are adjusted for available confounders. Early neonatal mortality did not differ by frequency of facility delivery in the community. Conclusions While better geographic access and higher level of care were associated with more frequent facility delivery, there was no association with lower early neonatal mortality. This could be due to low quality of care for newborns at health facilities, but differential underreporting of early neonatal deaths in the {DHS} is an alternative explanation. Improved data sources are needed to monitor progress in the provision of obstetric and newborn care and its impact on mortality.},

	abstract = {The Malawi Journals Project is one of the longest-running observational field studies in rural sub-Saharan Africa, ongoing since 1999. The journals provide real-time accounts of the unfolding epidemic, from the days when {AIDS} was considered by rural Malawians to be a death sentence, through the advent of international {AIDS} organisations bearing advice on avoiding infections by self-control, and then the turn to institutionally-based efforts to control infection through {HIV} testing and antiretroviral medications. This paper examines the epistemological and substantive contributions of the Journals Project, which we and others who have analysed the journals have made to understanding the {AIDS} epidemic. The paper has three primary aims. The first is to provide evidence of the chasm between the top-down perspectives of global actors with a mandate to address the pandemic and the bottom-up perspectives of local actors trying to avoid dying from {AIDS}, perspectives that are often contradictory. Second, beyond what can be learned from the journals about individual and collective responses to {AIDS}, they suggest the value of longitudinal observational field studies as a method for understanding how cultural change occurs. And third, as an example of the potential of longitudinal field studies as a research method on {AIDS} as well as other topics, we have structured our argument around the broader empirical and theoretical debates in the social sciences featured in published and presented analyses of the Malawi journals data: multiple moral logics, the course of global flows of information and injunctions, and the collective deliberation that produces authoritative local knowledge.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a newly developed interactive elicitation methodology for collecting probabilistic expectations in a developing country context with low levels of literacy and numeracy, and we evaluate the feasibility and success of this method for a wide range of outcomes in rural Malawi. We find that respondents’ answers about their subjective expectations take into account basic properties of probabilities, and vary meaningfully with observable characteristics and past experience. From a substantive point of view, the elicited expectations indicate that individuals are generally aware of differential risks. For example, individuals with lower incomes and less land rightly feel at greater risk of financial distress than people with higher socioeconomic status ({SES}), and people who are divorced or widowed rightly feel at greater risk of being infected with {HIV} than currently married individuals. Meanwhile many expectations—including the probability of being currently infected with {HIV}—are well-calibrated compared to actual probabilities, but mortality expectations are substantially overestimated compared to life table estimates. This overestimation may lead individuals to underestimate the benefits of adopting {HIV} risk-reduction strategies. The skewed distribution of expectations about condom use also suggests that a small group of innovators are the forerunners in the adoption of condoms within marriage for {HIV} prevention.},

	abstract = {In high-income countries, emerging research suggests sibling bereavement can have significant health and life course consequences for young people. Yet, we know far less about its burden in lower-income countries. Due to higher fertility and mortality in lower-income countries, the level, timing, intensity, and circumstances surrounding sibling mortality are likely to follow patterns distinct from those in higher-income settings. Thus, in this study, we offer a descriptive overview of sibling death in 43 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Specifically, we analyze Demographic and Health Survey data from nationally representative samples of 352,930 15- to 34-year-old women, born between 1985 and 2003, to document experiences of sibling death before age 25. On average, roughly one-third of individuals report a deceased sibling in these countries; estimates reach 40–50\% of respondents in multiple African countries, particularly those that have experienced conflict and war. Although some sibling deaths occurred before the focal respondent was born, most bereaved individuals recalled a death during their lifetime—often in late childhood/early adolescence. High proportions of bereaved respondents report multiple sibling deaths, highlighting the clustering of deaths within families. Even so, bereaved individuals tend to come from large families and thus frequently have a comparable number of surviving siblings as people who never experienced a sibling die. Together, the results offer a window into global inequality in childhood experiences, and they attest to the need for research that explores the implications of sibling mortality for young people in world regions where the experience is concentrated.},

The widespread practice of polygyny is one feature of many sub-Saharan African contexts that may be relevant to understanding patterns of infant mortality. Building on evidence that the prevalence of polygyny reflects broader economic, social, and cultural features and that it has implications for how families engage in the practice, we investigate whether and how the prevalence of polygyny (1) spills over to elevate infant mortality for all families, and (2) conditions the survival disadvantage for children living in polygynous families (i.e., compared with monogamous families). We use data from Demographic and Health Surveys to estimate multilevel hazard models that identify associations between infant mortality and region-level prevalence of polygyny for 236,336 children in 260 subnational regions across 29 sub-Saharan African countries. We find little evidence that the prevalence of polygyny influences mortality for infants in nonpolygynous households net of region-level socioeconomic factors and gender inequality. However, the prevalence of polygyny significantly amplifies the survival disadvantage for infants in polygynous families. Our findings demonstrate that considering the broader marital context reveals important insights into the relationship between family structure and child well-being.},

We use detailed reproductive data in combination with fine-scale climate data to examine pregnancy outcomes among women in sub-Saharan Africa, a region that shelters some of the poorest families in the world. Fine-scale precipitation and temperature data allow each pregnancy to be matched to the relevant climate exposures. We investigate the linkages between climate and pregnancy outcomes using linear probability models with fixed effects to minimize confounding due to factors that vary by location, season, and year. We analyze retrospective pregnancy data from more than 65,000 pregnancies recorded in 23 surveys across 15 African countries. Our results indicate that pregnancy outcomes are indeed impacted by exposure to hot days even after considering other individual-level characteristics. This research provides insight into the linkages between climate and a major adverse health outcome faced by women. In doing so, this research expands scientific understanding of the impact of environmental factors on fertility outcomes.},

With nearly 40\% of the U.S. population being residents of coastal areas, understanding the anticipated demographic changes in coastal counties is important for long-range planning purposes. In this research note, we use long-range, county-level population projections based on a simplified cohort-component method to discuss demographic changes by age, sex, and race and ethnicity for coastal counties between 2020 and the end of the century, and we compare these changes to inland counties. Presently, coastal counties are statistically significantly different from inland counties by race and ethnicity (more diverse) and sex (more women) but not by age, yet by 2025, we expect coastal counties to become significantly older than inland counties. We note several important trajectories of predicted demographic outcomes in coastal counties across the remainder of the century: (1) the non-Hispanic White population is expected to decrease, both numerically and as a percentage of the population; (2) the population older than 65 is projected to increase, both numerically and as a percentage of the population; and (3) the ratio of women to men remains constant over the century at 1.03. These trends combine to suggest that the future U.S. coastline will likely be both increasingly diverse racially and ethnically and significantly older than it is today.},

Here, we demonstrate that for millennia, human populations have resided in the same narrow part of the climatic envelope available on the globe, characterized by a major mode around ∼11 °C to 15 °C mean annual temperature ({MAT}). Supporting the fundamental nature of this temperature niche, current production of crops and livestock is largely limited to the same conditions, and the same optimum has been found for agricultural and nonagricultural economic output of countries through analyses of year-to-year variation. We show that in a business-as-usual climate change scenario, the geographical position of this temperature niche is projected to shift more over the coming 50 y than it has moved since 6000 {BP}. Populations will not simply track the shifting climate, as adaptation in situ may address some of the challenges, and many other factors affect decisions to migrate. Nevertheless, in the absence of migration, one third of the global population is projected to experience a {MAT} {\textgreater}29 °C currently found in only 0.8\% of the Earth’s land surface, mostly concentrated in the Sahara. As the potentially most affected regions are among the poorest in the world, where adaptive capacity is low, enhancing human development in those areas should be a priority alongside climate mitigation.},

I argue that the changing ecological environment of Lake Victoria, Africa’s largest freshwater lake, mapping onto a gendered economy, shaped fisherfolk’s sexual relationships and sexual mixing patterns in ways that were consequential for their {HIV} risk. Specifically, I show how disrupted lake and fish ecology had an impact on fishermen’s sexual, domestic and economic partnerships, as well as how it contributed to the “sex for fish” economy in Nyanza Province, Kenya. I also show the consequences of fishermen’s relative wealth on transactional relationships with school girls and women in lakeside communities. The paper is based on ethnographic fieldwork over a seven month period among the Luo ethnic group, which has the highest {HIV} rates in Kenya. The study included 74 individual and focus group interviews in communities around Lake Victoria, as well as 20 key informant interviews. Additionally, literature reviews on fishing and sexual economies as well as on ecological research in Lake Victoria are employed. Exploring linkages between these literatures and fieldwork findings forms the basis of this paper.

The hurricane's adverse impact on survivors' mental health was apparent shortly after the storm and persisted, but no study has examined the long-term effects now that more than a decade has transpired. Using new data from a panel study of low-income mothers interviewed once before Hurricane Katrina and now three times after, we document changes in mental health, and estimate the sociodemographic and hurricane-related factors associated with long-term trajectories of mental health. We find that post-traumatic stress symptoms ({PTSS}) declined at each of the three post-Katrina follow-ups, but 12 years after the hurricane, one in six still had symptoms indicative of probable post-traumatic stress disorder. The rate of non-specific psychological distress ({PD}) remained consistently higher in all three follow-ups, compared to the pre-disaster period. In full covariate-adjusted models, no sociodemographic variables predicted long-run combinations of {PTSS} and {PD}. However, 12 years later, exposure to hurricane-related traumatic events and pre-disaster {PD} significantly predicted co-occurring {PTSS} and {PD}. Hurricane-related housing damage predicted {PTSS} in earlier follow-ups, but no longer predicted {PTSS} in the long-term. Furthermore, hurricane-related traumatic events significantly differentiated the risk of having persistent {PTSS}, relative to recovering from {PTSS}. The results suggest that there is still a non-negligible group of survivors with continued need for recovery resources and that exposure to traumatic events is a primary predictor of adverse mental health more than a decade post-disaster.},

To evaluate this model, we follow 1,266 children in Chicago from birth through school entry and track both their areal risk of lead exposure and their neighborhoods' socioeconomic composition over time. With these data, we estimate the joint effects of neighborhood poverty and environmental lead contamination on receptive vocabulary ability.

It is an integral method for modeling and simulating complex systems, such as socio-economic problems. Since agent-based models are not described by simple and concise mathematical equations, the code that generates them is typically complicated, large, and slow. Here we present Agents.jl, a Julia-based software that provides an {ABM} analysis platform with minimal code complexity. We compare our software with some of the most popular {ABM} software in other programming languages. We find that Agents.jl is not only the most performant but also the least complicated software, providing the same (and sometimes more) features as the competitors with less input required from the user. Agents.jl also integrates excellently with the entire Julia ecosystem, including interactive applications, differential equations, parameter optimization, and so on. This removes any “extensions library” requirement from Agents.jl, which is paramount in many other tools.},

In addition, we tested the association between specific characteristics of community environments and child nutritional status.{DesignCross}-sectional survey.{SettingThe} data are from the nationally representative 2004 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey.{SubjectsRespondents} were ever-married women (aged 15–49 years) and their children (n 5731), residing in 361 communities. Child nutritional outcomes are physical measurements of weight-for-age and height-for-age in sd units. We considered the following attributes of community environments potentially related to child nutrition: (i) community water and sanitation infrastructure; (ii) availability of community health and education services; (iii) community employment and social participation; and (iv) education level of the community.{ResultsMultilevel} regression analysis showed that the spatial distribution of maternal and child covariates did not entirely explain the between-community variation in child nutritional status. The education level of the community emerged as the strongest community-level predictor of child height-for-age (highest v. lowest tertile, β = 0·18 (se 0·07)) and weight-for-age (highest v. lowest tertile, β = 0·21 (se 0·06)). In the height-for-age model, community employment and social participation also emerged as being statistically significant (highest v. lowest tertile, β = 0·13 (se = 0·06)).{ConclusionsThe} community environment influences child nutrition in Bangladesh, and maternal- and child-level covariates may fail to capture the entire influence of communities. Interventions to reduce child undernutrition in developing countries should take into consideration the wider community context.},

We examine the consequences of prenatal exposure for infant health, through which the pandemic may have lasting intergenerational effects. We examine multiple pathways by which the pandemic shaped birth outcomes and socioeconomic disparities in these consequences. Analysis of more than 3.5 million birth records in California with universal information on {COVID} infection among persons giving birth at the time of delivery reveals deep inequalities in infection by education, race/ethnicity, and place-based socioeconomic disadvantage. {COVID} infection during pregnancy, in turn, predicts a large increase in the probability of preterm birth, by approximately one third. At the population level, a surprising reduction in preterm births during the first months of the pandemic was followed by an increase in preterm births during the surge in {COVID} infections in the winter of 2021. Whereas the early-pandemic reduction in preterm births benefited primarily highly educated mothers, the increase in preterm births during the winter infection surge was entirely concentrated among mothers with low levels of schooling. The {COVID}-19 pandemic is expected to exacerbate U.S. inequality in multiple ways. Our findings highlight a particularly enduring pathway: the long-term legacy of prenatal exposure to an unequal pandemic environment.},

Yet, estimating the consequences of prenatal stress on children’s outcomes is complicated by the issue of confounding (i.e., unobserved factors correlated with stress exposure and with children’s outcomes). I combine a natural experiment—a strong earthquake in Chile—with a panel survey to capture the effect of prenatal exposure on acute stress and children’s cognitive ability. I find that stress exposure in early pregnancy has no effect on children’s cognition among middle-class families, but it has a strong negative influence among disadvantaged families. I then examine possible pathways accounting for the socioeconomic stratification in the effect of stress, including differential exposure across socioeconomic status, differential sensitivity, and parental responses. Findings suggest that the interaction between prenatal exposures and socioeconomic advantage provides a powerful mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage.},

	abstract = {Changes in fertility patterns are hypothesized to be among the many second-order consequences of armed conflict, but expectations about the direction of such effects are theoretically ambiguous. Prior research, from a range of contexts, has also yielded inconsistent results. We contribute to this debate by using harmonized data and methods to examine the effects of exposure to conflict on preferred and observed fertility outcomes across a spatially and temporally extensive population. We use high-resolution georeferenced data from 25 sub-Saharan African countries, combining records of violent events from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project ({ACLED}) with data on fertility goals and outcomes from the Demographic and Health Surveys (n = 368,765 women aged 15–49 years). We estimate a series of linear and logistic regression models to assess the effects of exposure to conflict events on ideal family size and the probability of childbearing within the 12 months prior to the interview. We find that, on average, exposure to armed conflict leads to modest reductions in both respondents’ preferred family size and their probability of recent childbearing. Many of these effects are heterogeneous between demographic groups and across contexts, which suggests systematic differences in women’s vulnerability or preferred responses to armed conflict. Additional analyses suggest that conflict-related fertility declines may be driven by delays or reductions in marriage. These results contribute new evidence about the demographic effects of conflict and their underlying mechanisms, and broadly underline the importance of studying the second-order effects of organized violence on vulnerable populations.},

In districts highly affected by the flu there is also an improvement in parental quality: we observe a relative increase in births to married women and better-off city dwellers.Our findings help understand the link between mortality and fertility, one of the central relations in demography, and show that several factors – including disruptions to marriage and labor markets – contribute to fertility reduction in the long term. Our results are consistent with studies that find a positive fertility response following natural disasters, but with high-quality historical data we show that this effect is short-lived.},

We investigate the fertility response to an unanticipated mortality shock that resulted from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which killed large shares of the residents of some Indonesian communities but caused no deaths in neighboring communities. Using population-representative multilevel longitudinal data, we identify a behavioral fertility response to mortality exposure, both at the level of a couple and in the broader community. We observe a sustained fertility increase at the aggregate level following the tsunami, which was driven by two behavioral responses to mortality exposure. First, mothers who lost one or more children in the disaster were significantly more likely to bear additional children after the tsunami. This response explains about 13 \% of the aggregate increase in fertility. Second, women without children before the tsunami initiated family-building earlier in communities where tsunami-related mortality rates were higher, indicating that the fertility of these women is an important route to rebuilding the population in the aftermath of a mortality shock. Such community-level effects have received little attention in demographic scholarship.},

	abstract = {The salutary effect of formal education on health-risk behaviors and mortality is extensively documented: ceteris paribus, greater educational attainment leads to healthier lives and longevity. Even though the epidemiological evidence has strongly indicated formal education as a leading “social vaccine,” there is intermittent reporting of counter-education gradients for health-risk behavior and associated outcomes for certain populations during specific periods. How can education have both beneficial and harmful effects on health, and under which contexts do particular effects emerge? It is useful to conceptualize the influence of education as a process sensitive to the nature, timing of entry, and uniqueness of a new pleasurable and desirable lifestyle and/or product (such as smoking) with initially unclear health risks for populations. Developed herein is a hypothesis that the education gradient comprises multiple potent pathways (material, psychological, cognitive) by which health-risk behaviors are influenced, and that there can be circumstances under which pathways act in opposite directions or are differentially suppressed and enhanced. We propose the population education transition ({PET}) curve as a unifying functional form to predict shifting education gradients across the onset and course of a population’s exposure to new health risks and their associated consequences. Then, we estimate {PET} curves for cases with prior epidemiological evidence of heterogeneous education gradients with health-risk behaviors related to mass-produced cigarettes in China and the United States; saturated fats, sugar, and processed food diets in Latin America; and {HIV} infection in sub-Saharan Africa. Each offers speculation on interactions between environmental factors during population exposure and education pathways to health-risk behaviors that could be responsible for the temporal dynamics of {PET} curves. Past epidemiological studies reporting either negative or positive education gradients may not represent contradictory findings as much as come from analyses unintentionally limited to just one part of the {PET} process. Last, the {PET} curve formulation offers richer nuances about educational pathways, macro-historical population dynamics, and the fundamental cause of disease paradigm.},

To address the effect of education on health in general, three contributions are provided: 1) a macro-level summary of the dimensions of the worldwide educational revolution and a reassessment of its causal role in the health of individuals and in the demographic health transition are carried out; 2) a meta-analysis of methodologically sophisticated studies of the effect of educational attainment on all-cause mortality is conducted to establish the independence and robustness of the education effect on health; and 3) a schooling-cognition hypothesis about the influence of education as a powerful determinant of health is developed in light of new multidis-ciplinary cognitive research.},

First, we draw on recent brain and cognition research to contextualize fertility intentions within a broader set of conscious and unconscious mechanisms that contribute to mental function. Next, we integrate this research with social theory. Our conceptualizations suggest that people do not necessarily have fertility intentions; they form them only when prompted by specific situations. Intention formation draws on the current situation and on schemas of childbearing and parenthood learned through previous experience, imbued by affect, and organized by self-representation. Using this conceptualization, we review apparently discordant knowledge about the value of fertility intentions in predicting fertility. Our analysis extends and deepens existing explanations for the weak predictive validity of fertility intentions at the individual level and provides a social-cognitive explanation for why intentions predict as well as they do. When focusing on the predictive power of intentions at the aggregate level, our conceptualizations lead us to focus on how social structures frustrate or facilitate intentions and how the structural environment contributes to the formation of reported intentions in the first place. Our analysis suggests that existing measures of fertility intentions are useful but to varying extents and in many cases despite their failure to capture what they seek to measure.},

These conclusions were accepted until the last several decades of the 1900s, when almost all were seriously challenged; many were declared to be myths. Further, the developmental paradigm, reading history sideways, and the conclusions of generations of social scientists created a package of ideas—developmental idealism—that subsequently became a powerful influence for family change in many parts of the world during the past two centuries.

	abstract = {Understanding how having children influences parents’ subjective well-being (“happiness”) has great potential to explain fertility behavior. We study parental happiness trajectories before and after the birth of a child, using large British and German longitudinal data sets. We account for unobserved parental characteristics using fixed-effects models and study how sociodemographic factors modify the parental happiness trajectories. Consistent with existing work, we find that happiness increases in the years around the birth of a first child and then decreases to before-child levels. Moreover, happiness increases before birth, suggesting that the trajectories may capture not only the effect of the birth but also the broader process of childbearing, which may include partnership formation and quality. Sociodemographic factors strongly modify this pattern. Those who have children at older ages or who have more education have a particularly positive happiness response to a first birth; and although having the first two children increases happiness, having a third child does not. The results, which are similar in Britain and Germany, suggest that having up to two children increases happiness, and mostly for those who have postponed childbearing. This pattern is consistent with the fertility behavior that emerged during the second demographic transition and provides new insights into low and late fertility.},

We compare the relationships and fertility behaviors of three groups: exclusively heterosexual (consistent heterosexual behavior, identity, and attraction); mostly heterosexual (heterosexual identity with same-sex behavior and/or same-sex attraction); and {LGBTQ} (any non-heterosexual identity). We find that mostly heterosexual and {LGBTQ} women behave differently from exclusively heterosexual women in ways likely to elevate their risk of unintended pregnancy: more distinct partners during the study period, more sexual intercourse with men, less frequent contraceptive use, less use of a dual method (condom plus hormonal method), and more gaps in contraceptive coverage. Mostly heterosexual women resemble {LGBTQ} women in their contraceptive behavior but have significantly more intercourse with men, which may increase their pregnancy risk relative to both {LGBTQ} and exclusively heterosexual women. We conclude by considering implications for {LGBTQ} health and the measurement of sexual minority populations.},

We measure social interaction through the cross-sibling influences on fertility. Continuous-time hazard models are estimated separately for women’s first and second births. In addition to individual socioeconomic variables, demographic variables, and an unobserved factor specific to each sibling pair, siblings’ birth events and their timing enter as time-varying covariates. We use data from longitudinal population-wide Norwegian administrative registers. The data cover more than 110,000 sibling pairs and include the siblings’ fertility, education, income, and marital histories.

Our approach parameterizes cluster-indexed random effects in both a marginal model for the response and a conditional model for published, unit-level sampling weights. We compare our method to plug-in Bayesian and frequentist alternatives in a simulation study and demonstrate that our method most closely achieves correct uncertainty quantification for model parameters, including the generating variances for cluster-indexed random effects.

Despite increases in female grade attainment over the past twenty years, the age at first birth has not changed. Using instrumental variables analysis, I find a significant negative association between grade attainment and age at first birth, suggesting that the deterioration of school quality and shift in the age pattern of enrollment that accompanied educational expansion may have compromised the transformative potential of education.},

The argument compares the determinants and consequences of recent family trends in industrialized societies provided by two narratives: the {SDT} and the gender revolution in the public and private spheres. Our argument examines differences in theoretical foundations and positive vs. negative implications for the future. We focus primarily on the growing evidence for turnarounds in the relationships between measures of women's human capital and union formation, fertility, and union dissolution, and consider evidence that men's home involvement increases union formation and fertility and decreases union instability. Although the family trends underlying the {SDT} and the gender revolution narratives are ongoing and a convincing view of the phenomenon has not yet emerged, the wide range of recent research results documenting changing, even reversing relationships suggests that the gender approach is increasingly the more fruitful one.},

Using data from three rounds of the demographic and health survey, we show clear evidence of son preference in fertility intentions, patterns of contraceptive use and parity progression ratios. More specifically, we find pervasive evidence that Pakistanis continue childbearing to have a son, to have more than one son and to have at least one daughter.

	abstract = {Introduction Reducing maternal mortality remains a priority for global health. One in five maternal deaths, globally, are from Nigeria. Objective This study aimed to assess the sociocultural correlates of maternal mortality in Nigeria. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of nationally representative data from the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey. The analysis was based on responses from the core women’s questionnaire. Maternal mortality was categorized as ‘yes’ for any death while pregnant, during delivery or two months after delivery (as reported by the sibling), and ‘no’ for deaths of other or unknown causes. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was conducted to test for association between maternal mortality and predictor variables of sociocultural status (educational attainment, community women’s education, region, type of residence, religion, and women’s empowerment). Results Region, Religion, and the level of community women’s education were independently associated with maternal mortality. Women in the North West were more than twice as likely to report maternal mortality ({OR}: 2.14; 95\% {CI}: 1.42–3.23) compared to those in the North Central region. Muslim women were 52\% more likely to report maternal deaths ({OR}: 1.52; 95\% {CI}: 1.10–2.11) compared to Christian women. Respondents living in communities where a significant proportion of women have at least secondary schooling were 33\% less likely to report that their sisters died of pregnancy-related causes ({OR}: 0.67; 95\% {CI}: 0.48–0.95). Conclusion Efforts to reduce maternal mortality should implement tailored programs that address barriers to health-seeking behavior influenced by cultural beliefs and attitudes, and low educational attainment. Strategies to improve women’s agency should be at the core of these programs; they are essential for reducing maternal mortality and achieving sustainable development goals towards gender equality. Future studies should develop empirically evaluated measures which assess, and further investigate the association between women’s empowerment and maternal health status and outcomes.},

We question the emphasis on such individually-based risk factors and argue that greater attention must be paid to basic social conditions if health reform is to have its maximum effect in the time ahead. There are two reasons for this claim. First we argue that individually-based risk factors must be contextualized, by examining what puts people at risk of risks, if we are to craft effective interventions and improve the nation's health. Second, we argue that social factors such as socioeconomic status and social support are likely "fundamental causes" of disease that, because they embody access to important resources, affect multiple disease outcomes through multiple mechanisms, and consequently maintain an association with disease even when intervening mechanisms change. Without careful attention to these possibilities, we run the risk of imposing individually-based intervention strategies that are ineffective and of missing opportunities to adopt broad-based societal interventions that could produce substantial health benefits for our citizens.},

Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ({BRFSS}) data from 32 U.S. states and territories between 2014 and 2016 yield an analytic sample that identifies 2,229 transgender and gender-nonconforming adults and 516,753 cisgender adults. Estimates from logistic regression models, using cisgender men as a reference group, show that gender-nonconforming respondents have significantly higher odds of reporting poor self-rated health than any other gender identity group. Transgender men also display higher odds of reporting poor health in some models, corresponding to their relative socioeconomic disadvantage. I find no apparent health disadvantage among transgender women and a persistent, if slight, disadvantage among cisgender women. Gender-nonconforming respondents’ predicted probabilities of reporting poor health remain nearly twice as high as those of cisgender men after adjustments for demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors. Their persistent patterns of health-related disadvantage underscore the need for higher-quality data on gender-nonconforming respondents that account for sex assigned at birth.},

This estimate quantifies the magnitude of an increase in pregnancy-related deaths that would occur solely because of the greater mortality risk of continuing a pregnancy rather than having a legal induced abortion. Using published statistics on pregnancy-related mortality ratios, births, and abortions, I estimate U.S. pregnancy-related deaths by race and ethnicity before and in the first and subsequent years of a hypothetical total abortion ban. The number of estimated deaths following a total abortion ban is determined by assuming three conditions: that all wanted induced abortions are denied, that each abortion denied leads to 0.8 births, and that there is a corresponding increase in exposure to pregnancy-related mortality. I find that in the first year of such a ban, estimated pregnancy-related deaths would increase from 675 to 724 (49 additional deaths, representing a 7\% increase), and in subsequent years to 815 (140 additional deaths, for a 21\% increase). Non-Hispanic Black people would experience the greatest increase in deaths (a 33\% increase in subsequent years). Estimated pregnancy-related deaths would increase for all races and ethnicities examined. Overall, denying all wanted induced abortions in the United States would increase pregnancy-related mortality substantially, even if the rate of unsafe abortion did not increase.},

Some {US} state policies appear to be key levers for improving life expectancy, such as policies on tobacco, labor, immigration, civil rights, and the environment. {US} life expectancy is estimated to be 2.8 years longer among women and 2.1 years longer among men if all {US} states enjoyed the health advantages of states with more liberal policies, which would put {US} life expectancy on par with other high-income countries. Context Life expectancy in the United States has increased little in previous decades, declined in recent years, and become more unequal across {US} states. Those trends were accompanied by substantial changes in the {US} policy environment, particularly at the state level. State policies affect nearly every aspect of people's lives, including economic well-being, social relationships, education, housing, lifestyles, and access to medical care. This study examines the extent to which the state policy environment may have contributed to the troubling trends in {US} life expectancy. Methods We merged annual data on life expectancy for {US} states from 1970 to 2014 with annual data on 18 state-level policy domains such as tobacco, environment, tax, and labor. Using the 45 years of data and controlling for differences in the characteristics of states and their populations, we modeled the association between state policies and life expectancy, and assessed how changes in those policies may have contributed to trends in {US} life expectancy from 1970 through 2014. Findings Results show that changes in life expectancy during 1970-2014 were associated with changes in state policies on a conservative-liberal continuum, where more liberal policies expand economic regulations and protect marginalized groups. States that implemented more conservative policies were more likely to experience a reduction in life expectancy. We estimated that the shallow upward trend in {US} life expectancy from 2010 to 2014 would have been 25\% steeper for women and 13\% steeper for men had state policies not changed as they did. We also estimated that {US} life expectancy would be 2.8 years longer among women and 2.1 years longer among men if all states enjoyed the health advantages of states with more liberal policies. Conclusions Understanding and reversing the troubling trends and growing inequalities in {US} life expectancy requires attention to {US} state policy contexts, their dynamic changes in recent decades, and the forces behind those changes. Changes in {US} political and policy contexts since the 1970s may undergird the deterioration of Americans’ health and longevity.},

	abstract = {There is an expectation that, on average, pain will increase with age, through accumulated injury, physical wear and tear, and an increasing burden of disease. Consistent with that expectation, pain rises with age into old age in other wealthy countries. However, in America today, the elderly report less pain than those in midlife. This is the mystery of American pain. Using multiple datasets and definitions of pain, we show today’s midlife Americans have had more pain throughout adulthood than did today’s elderly. Disaggregating the cross-section of ages by year of birth and completion of a bachelor’s degree, we find, for those with less education, that each successive birth cohort has a higher prevalence of pain at each age—a result not found for those with a bachelor’s degree. Thus, the gap in pain between the more and less educated has widened in each successive birth cohort. The increase seen across birth cohorts cannot be explained by changes in occupation or levels of obesity for the less educated, but fits a more general pattern seen in the ongoing erosion of working-class life for those born after 1950. If these patterns continue, pain prevalence will continue to increase for all adults; importantly, tomorrow’s elderly will be sicker than today’s elderly, with potentially serious implications for healthcare.},

	abstract = {The decline of manufacturing employment is frequently invoked as a key cause of worsening U.S. population health trends, including rising mortality due to “deaths of despair.” Increasing automation—the use of industrial robots to perform tasks previously done by human workers—is one structural force driving the decline of manufacturing jobs and wages. In this study, we examine the impact of automation on age- and sex-specific mortality. Using exogenous variation in automation to support causal inference, we find that increases in automation over the period 1993–2007 led to substantive increases in all-cause mortality for both men and women aged 45–54. Disaggregating by cause, we find evidence that automation is associated with increases in drug overdose deaths, suicide, homicide, and cardiovascular mortality, although patterns differ by age and sex. We further examine heterogeneity in effects by safety net program generosity, labor market policies, and the supply of prescription opioids.},

	abstract = {This study addresses two questions. First, why do Black Americans exhibit worse health outcomes than White Americans even at higher levels of socioeconomic status ({SES})? Second, are diminished health returns to higher status concentrated among Black Americans with darker skin color? Novel hypotheses are tested with biosocial panel data from Add Health, a nationally representative cohort of Black and White adolescents who have transitioned to adulthood. We find that White and light-skin Black respondents report improved health after achieving higher {SES}, on average, while their darker-skin Black peers report declining health. These patterns persist regardless of controls for adolescent health status and unmeasured between-person heterogeneity. Moreover, increased inflammation tied to unfair treatment and perceptions of lower status helps to account for patterns of diminished health returns for dark-skin Black groups. Our study is the first to document skin tone heterogeneity in diminished health returns and one of few studies to identify life course stress processes underlying such disparities. We consider additional processes that could be examined in future studies, as well as the broader health and policy implications of our findings.},

We estimate the lifetime and age-specific risks of being killed by police by race and sex. We also provide estimates of the proportion of all deaths accounted for by police use of force. We find that African American men and women, American Indian/Alaska Native men and women, and Latino men face higher lifetime risk of being killed by police than do their white peers. We find that Latina women and Asian/Pacific Islander men and women face lower risk of being killed by police than do their white peers. Risk is highest for black men, who (at current levels of risk) face about a 1 in 1,000 chance of being killed by police over the life course. The average lifetime odds of being killed by police are about 1 in 2,000 for men and about 1 in 33,000 for women. Risk peaks between the ages of 20 y and 35 y for all groups. For young men of color, police use of force is among the leading causes of death.},

Access helps determine whether the individual makes contact with the family planning provider, while quality of care greatly affects the client's decision to accept a method and the motivation to continue using it. Medical barriers are scientifically unjustifiable policies or practices, based at least in part on a medical rationale, that inappropriately prevent clients from receiving the contraceptive method of their choice or impose unnecessary process barriers to access to family planning services. In the past, international family planning efforts have been criticized as placing too much emphasis on issues of access and the quantity of contraceptives distributed. The climate now exists for pursuing improvements in quality and access simultaneously and for exploring through research the linkages between access, quality and medical barriers.},

	abstract = {Background
Analyzing Body Mass Index as a didactical example, the study by Evans, Williams, Onnela, and Subramanian ({EWOS} study) introduce a novel methodology for the investigation of socioeconomic disparities in health. By using multilevel analysis to model health inequalities within and between strata defined by the intersection of multiple social and demographic dimensions, the authors provide a better understanding of the health heterogeneity existing in the population. Their innovative methodology allows for gathering inductive information on a large number of stratum-specific interactions of effects and, simultaneously, informs on the discriminatory accuracy of such strata for predicting individual health. Their study provides an excellent answer to the call for suitable quantitative methodologies within the intersectionality framework.
Rationale
The {EWOS} study is a well-written tutorial; thus, in this commentary, I will not repeat the explanation of the statistical/epidemiological concepts. Instead, I will share with the reader a number of thoughts on the theoretical consequences derived from the application of multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy ({MAIHDA}) in (social) epidemiology in general, and within the intersectional framework in particular. {MAIHDA} is a reorganization of concepts that allows for a better understanding of the distribution and determinants of individual health and disease risk in the population.
Conclusions
By applying {MAIHD} within an intersectional framework, the {EWOS} study provides a superior theoretical and quantitative instrument for documenting health disparities and it should become the new gold standard for investigating health disparities in (social) epidemiology. This approach is more appropriate for eco-social perspectives than the habitual probabilistic strategy based on differences between group average risks. However, both, the translation of intersectionality theory into (social) epidemiology and the intersectional quantitative methodology (especially for generalized linear models) are still under development.},

	shorttitle = {Typical-use contraceptive failure rates in 43 countries with Demographic and Health Survey data},
	abstract = {Background
While most unintended pregnancies occur because couples do not use contraception, contraceptive failure is also an important underlying cause. However, few recent studies outside of the United States have estimated contraceptive failure rates, and most such studies have been restricted to married women, to a limited number of countries and to 12-month failure rate estimates.
Methods
Using self-reported data from 43 countries with Demographic and Health Survey data, we estimated typical-use contraceptive failure rates for seven contraceptive methods at 12, 24 and 36months of use. We provide a median estimate for each method across 43 countries overall, in seven subregions and in individual countries. We assess differences by various demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Estimates are not corrected for potential errors in retrospective reporting contraceptive use or potential underreporting of abortion, which may vary by country and subgroups within countries.
Results
Across all included countries, reported 12-month typical-use failure rates were lowest for users of longer-acting methods such as implants (0.6 failures per 100 episodes of use), intrauterine devices (1.4) and injectables (1.7); intermediate for users of short-term resupply methods such as oral contraceptive pills (5.5) and male condoms (5.4); and highest for users of traditional methods such as withdrawal (13.4) or periodic abstinence (13.9), a group largely using calendar rhythm.
Conclusions
Our findings help us to highlight those methods, subregions and population groups that may be in need of particular attention for improvements in policies and programs to address higher contraceptive failure rates.},

The purpose of this article is to propose a taxonomic definition of "access." Access is presented here as a general concept that summarizes a set of more specific dimensions describing the fit between the patient and the health care system. The specific dimensions are availability, accessibility, accommodation, affordability and acceptability. Using interview data on patient satisfaction, the discriminant validity of these dimensions is investigated.

	abstract = {In many low and middle-income countries patients often bypass the nearest government health center offering free or subsidized services and seek more expensive care elsewhere. This study examines the role of quality of care, in particular clinician competence and structural quality of the health center, on bypassing behavior. Data for this study comes from a survey of 136 primary health centers ({PHCs}) and 3517 individuals living in the {PHC}'s immediate vicinity in rural Chhattisgarh, India. Overall, the majority (67\%) of patients bypassed the local {PHC} when seeking treatment. Bypassing decreased as provider competence increased, up to a point, after which, improvements in competency did not reduce bypassing. The clinical competence of the health care provider had a greater effect on reducing bypassing compared to {PHC} structural quality such as the building condition and drug stock-outs. However, the regular presence of clinical providers in the {PHC} was associated with lower bypassing. Patients that visited the local {PHC} spent half as much out-of-pocket as those that were treated at private clinics. Poor patients were less likely to bypass the local {PHC} compared to non-poor patients. These findings suggest that improving structural quality is not sufficient to reduce bypassing of {PHCs}. While better provider competency can substantially reduce bypassing, beyond a threshold competency level there is little effect. Efforts to strengthen facility-based primary care services need to go beyond simply focusing on improving infrastructure or quality of clinical care. There is a need to rethink how {PHCs} can be made more relevant to the health care needs of the communities they serve.},

However, studies have not used routinely collected health service birth data at named health facilities to understand the influence of distance and quality of care on childbirth service utilisation. Thus, this paper aims to quantify the influence of distance and quality of healthcare on utilisation of birthing services using routine health data in Eastern Region, Ghana.
Methods We used a spatial interaction model (a model that predicts movement from one place to another) drawing on routine birth data, emergency obstetric care surveys, gridded estimates of number of pregnancies and health facility location. We compared travel distances by sociodemographic characteristics and mapped movement patterns.
Results A kilometre increase in distance significantly reduced the prevalence rate of the number of women giving birth in health facilities by 6.7\%. Although quality care increased the number of women giving birth in health facilities, its association was insignificant. Women travelled further than expected to give birth at facilities, on average journeying 4.7 km beyond the nearest facility with a recorded birth. Women in rural areas travelled 4 km more than urban women to reach a hospital. We also observed that 56\% of women bypassed the nearest hospital to their community.
Conclusion This analysis provides substantial opportunities for health planners and managers to understand further patterns of skilled birth service utilisation, and demonstrates the value of routine health data. Also, it provides evidence-based information for improving maternal health service provision by targeting specific communities and health facilities.},

A principal strategy used in low- and middle-income countries is increasing the proportion of pregnancies delivered at facilities. Although this strategy is reasonable with high quality facilities, evidence for the protective effects of facility deliveries is mixed. Methods: We pooled 1.47 million birth records collected by the Demographic and Health Surveys to estimate the association between institutional deliveries and early neonatal mortality. Subsample analysis and instrumental variable estimation were used to assess and correct the extent to which mortality differentials are biased by an increased likelihood of facility attendance for high-risk deliveries. Results: No associations between institutional deliveries and early neonatal mortality were found in the pooled sample [adjusted odds ratio ({aOR}) 0.995, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.966-1.025)]. When stratified by facility type, protective effects were found for private facilities ({aOR} 0.876, 95\% {CI} 0.840-0.914), but not for public hospitals or health centres. Significant protective effects were found when past behaviour was used to eliminate selection bias generated by short-term responses to medical need ({aOR} 0.884, 95\% {CI} 0.814-0.961). At the community and country levels, strong positive associations were found between early neonatal mortality among facility deliveries and the prevalence of institutional deliveries. Conclusion: Facility deliveries have the potential to reduce early neonatal mortality in developing countries. The results presented suggest that the quality, utilization and protective effects of institutional deliveries vary widely across countries; major improvements in both utilization and quality of care will be needed to achieve further improvements in maternal and child health.},

In this study, we revisit this relation in the rural areas of four countries: Ghana, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Using a structural equation modeling approach that corrects for endogeneity, in all four countries we find that the usual simpler probit (or logit) models tend to underestimate the direct effect of antenatal care on skilled birth attendance. Furthermore, in two of the countries, this estimated effect is mediated by the range of services offered to women during antenatal care. These results suggest that governments and {NGOs} should place more importance on the role of antenatal care providers and on the services they offer, in efforts to promote skilled birth attendance.},

Our calculation of world height inequality indicates that, in contrast with similar research on income inequality, within-country variation is the source of most inequality, rather than the differences between countries.},

We address a question not considered in earlier research: Do the strongest predictors of survival vary by age, sex or race/ethnicity? The analysis uses hazard models with 30 well-established predictors to examine five-year survival in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We find that the simple measure of self-assessed health and self-reported measures of functional ability and disability are the strongest predictors in all demographic groups, and are generally ranked considerably higher than biomarkers. Among the biomarkers, serum albumin is highly ranked in most demographic groups, whereas clinical measures of cardiovascular and metabolic function are consistently among the weakest predictors. Despite these similarities, there is substantial variation in the leading predictors across demographic groups, most notably by race and ethnicity},

We propose a novel and timely lifespan variation measure, which we call the cross-sectional average inequality in lifespan, or {CAL}†. This new index provides an alternative perspective on the analysis of lifespan inequality by combining the mortality histories of all cohorts present in a cross-sectional approach. We demonstrate how differences in the {CAL}† measure can be decomposed between populations by age and cohort to explore the compression or expansion of mortality in a cohort perspective. We apply these new methods using data from 10 low-mortality countries or regions from 1879 to 2013. {CAL}† reveals greater uncertainty in the timing of death than the period life table–based indices of variation indicate. Also, country rankings of lifespan inequality vary considerably between period and cross-sectional measures. These differences raise intriguing questions as to which temporal dimension is the most relevant to individuals when considering the uncertainty in the timing of death in planning their life courses.},

Covering more than 1,600 regions within 161 countries, the {SHDI} and its underlying dimension indices provide a 10 times higher resolution picture of human development than previously available. The newly observed within-country variation is particularly strong in low- and middle-developed countries. Education disparities explain most {SHDI} inequality within low-developed countries, and standard of living differences are most important within the more highly developed ones. Strong convergence forces operating both across and within countries have compensated the inequality enhancing force of population growth.

This article reports on changes in life expectancies around the world as far as they can be estimated from the evidence available at the end of 2021. The global life expectancy appears to have declined by 0.92 years between 2019 and 2020 and by another 0.72 years between 2020 and 2021, but the decline seems to have ended during the last quarter of 2021. Uncertainty about its exact size aside, this represents the first decline in global life expectancy since 1950, the first year for which a global estimate is available from the United Nations. Annual declines in life expectancy (from a 12-month period to the next) appear to have exceeded two years at some point before the end of 2021 in at least 50 countries. Since 1950, annual declines of that magnitude had only been observed on rare occasions, such as Cambodia in the 1970s, Rwanda in the 1990s, and possibly some sub-Saharan African nations at the peak of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ({AIDS}) pandemic.},

The surveys were selected to reflect diverse topics and foci; and provide an insight into analytic approaches across research themes. The search identified 159 articles appropriate for full text review and data extraction.Results:The analyses adopted in the multi-country surveys can be broadly classified as: univariate/bivariate analyses, and multivariate/multivariable analyses. Multivariate/multivariable analyses may be further divided into design- and model-based analyses. Of the 159 articles reviewed, 129 articles used model-based analysis, 30 articles used design-based analyses. Similar patterns could be seen in all the individual surveys.Conclusion:While there is general agreement among survey statisticians that complex surveys are most appropriately analyzed using design-based analyses, most researchers continued to use the more common model-based approaches. Recent developments in design-based multi-level analysis may be one approach to include all the survey design characteristics. This is a relatively new area, however, and there remains statistical, as well as applied analytic research required. An important limitation of this study relates to the selection of the surveys used and the choice of year for the analysis, i.e., year 2010 only. There is, however, no strong reason to believe that analytic strategies have changed radically in the past few years, and 2010 provides a credible snapshot of current practice.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Despite the pervasiveness of child marriage and its potentially adverse consequences on reproductive health outcomes, there is relatively little empirical evidence available on this issue, which has hindered efforts to improve the targeting of adolescent health programs. The purpose of this study was to assess the association of child marriage with fertility, fertility control, and maternal health care use outcomes in four South Asian countries: India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan.
Methods
Data for the study come from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in the study countries; we used a subsample of women aged 20–24 years. Child marriage, defined as first marriage before 18 years of age, is categorized into two groups: first married at ages 15–17 years and first married at age ≤14 years. We used multivariate logistic regression models.
Results
The results of the study suggest that child marriage is significantly associated with a history of rapid repeat childbirth, current modern contraceptive use, female sterilization, not using contraception before first childbirth, pregnancy termination, unintended pregnancy, and inadequate use of maternal health services, although the associations are not always consistent across countries. Furthermore, women who married in early adolescence or childhood show a higher propensity toward most of the negative outcomes, compared with women who married in middle adolescence.
Conclusions
Child marriage adds a layer of vulnerability to women that leads to poor fertility control and fertility-related outcomes, and low maternal health care use.},

	abstract = {Background: Access to health facilities remains limited in many resource-poor settings, and women and their children often have to travel far to seek care. However, data on distance are scarce, and it is unclear whether distance is associated with worse child health outcomes. We estimate the relationships between distance to facility, service utilization and child mortality in low- and middle-income countries.Methods: Population-representative data are pooled from 29 demographic and health surveys across 21 low- and middle-income countries. Multivariable logistic models and meta-analysis regressions are used to estimate associations between facility distance, child mortality, and health care utilization in the pooled sample as well as for each survey.Results: Compared with children who live within 1 km of a facility, children living within 2 km, 3 km, and 5 km of a facility have a 7.7\% [95\% confidence interval ({CI}): 0.927 – 1.251], 16.3\% (95\% {CI}: 1.020 – 1.327) and 25\% (95\% {CI}: 1.087 – 1.439) higher odds of neonatal mortality, respectively; children living farther than 10 km have a 26.6\% (95\% {CI}: 1.108 – 1.445) higher odds of neonatal mortality. Women living farther than 10 km from a facility have a 55.3\% lower odds of in-facility delivery compared with women who live within 1 km [odds ratio ({OR}): 0.447; 95\% {CI}: 0.394 – 0.508].Conclusions: Even relatively small distances from health facilities are associated with substantial mortality penalties for children. Policies that reduce travel distances and travel times are likely to increase utilization of health services and reduce neonatal mortality.},

Methods We used data from 217 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 74 countries between 1986 and 2013. We used modified Poisson regression to assess the impact of water and sanitation infrastructure on the prevalence of diarrhoea among children under 5. Results The impact of water and sanitation varied across surveys, and adjusting for socio-economic status drove these estimates towards the null. Sanitation had a greater effect than water infrastructure when all 217 surveys were pooled; however, the impact of sanitation diminished over time. Based on survey data from the past 10 years, we saw no evidence for benefits in improving drinking water or sanitation alone, but we estimated a 6\% reduction of both combined (prevalence ratio = 0.94, 95\% confidence limit 0.91–0.98). Conclusions Water and sanitation interventions should be combined to maximise the number of cases of diarrhoeal disease prevented in children under 5. Further research should identify the sources of variability seen between countries and across time. These national surveys likely include substantial measurement error in the categorisation of water and sanitation, making it difficult to interpret the roles of other pathways.},

	abstract = {Background The Sustainable Development Goal ({SDG}) 3 aims at reducing neonatal and under-5 mortality to below 12 per 1000 and 25 per 1000 live births, respectively, globally by 2030. Studies have found that initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth and continuous breastfeeding for over 12 months can positively impact neonatal and infant health. However, there is evidence that the sex of a child may influence the breastfeeding practices of a mother. Thus, we examined sex inequality in early breastfeeding initiation in sub-Saharan Africa. Materials and methods Data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 24 sub-Saharan African countries between January 2010 and December 2019 were pooled and analysed. A total of 137,677 women of reproductive age (15–49 years) were considered in this study. Bivariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed, and the results were presented using crude odds ratio ({cOR}) and adjusted odds ratio ({aOR}) with statistical significance at a p-value less than 0.05. Results The highest inequality in early initiation of breastfeeding was reported in Togo with a difference of 5.21\% between the female and male children, while the lowest inequality was reported in Guinea with 0.48\% difference between the female and male children. A higher odds of breastfeeding within 1 hour was observed among female children [{cOR} = 1.05; 95\%({CI} = 1.02–1.09)] compared to male children, and this persisted after controlling for the confounders included in this study [{aOR} = 1.05; 95\%({CI} = 1.02–1.08)]. Conclusion We found higher odds for early breastfeeding initiation of female children compared to male children in sub-Saharan Africa. To reduce breastfeeding initiation inequalities, programmes that educate and encourage early initiation of breastfeeding irrespective of the child sex should be promoted among mothers.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Sexual violence plays a key role in women's pregnancy intention. We investigated the influence of sexual violence on planned, mistimed, and unwanted pregnancies in sub-Saharan Africa ({SSA}).
Materials and methods
Data from the Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}) of 22 countries in {SSA} were used in this study. Both descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted. We carried out a multinomial logistic regression analysis to examine the effect of sexual violence on planned, mistimed, and unwanted pregnancies. {STATA} version 14.2 was used to carry out all analyses. Statistical significance was declared at p{\textless}0.05.
Results
At the descriptive level, we found that 74.1\% of women of reproductive age in {SSA} had planned pregnancies, with the remaining 25.9\% having either mistimed (20.4\%) or unwanted (5.5\%) pregnancies. Women in Nigeria had the lowest proportion of mistimed pregnancies (7.5\%) whereas those in Burundi had the greatest percentage of unwanted pregnancies (12.4\%). Women who had history of sexual violence had increased risk of mistimed [{ARRR} = 1.5, {CI} = 1.3–1.7] and unwanted pregnancies [{ARRR} = 1.6, {CI} = 1.3–2.0], compared to those with no history of sexual violence. Women aged 40–44 [{ARRR} = 3.3, {CI} = 1.4–7.6] and 45–49 [{ARRR} = 4.4, {CI} = 1.7–11.2] had higher risk of unwanted pregnancies, compared to women aged 15–19. Women who were cohabiting had higher risk of mistimed [{ARRR} = 1.3, {CI} = 1.1–1.4] and unwanted pregnancies [{ARRR} = 1.6, {CI} = 1.3–2.1], compared to married women.
Conclusion
Sexual violence plays a key role in mistimed and unwanted pregnancies. It is, therefore, prudent to develop various assessment techniques to detect sexual violence in unions and refer victims to appropriate services to diminish the risk of mistimed and unwanted pregnancies. Our findings provide a basis for developing and implementing policies and interventions aimed at reducing mistimed and unwanted pregnancies.},

	shorttitle = {Pooled prevalence and determinants of modern contraceptive utilization in East Africa},
	abstract = {Background According to the 2017 estimate, around 214 million reproductive-age women in developing regions who want to avoid pregnancy do not use a modern contraceptive method. Although there are studies done on factors associated with modern contraceptive utilization in individual East African countries, as to our search of the literature, there is limited evidence on the pooled prevalence and determinants of modern contraceptive utilization in the East African region. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence and determinants of modern contraceptive utilization in the East African region. Methods The pooled prevalence of modern contraceptive utilization and the strength of determinants were estimated using {STATA} version 14. Intra-class Correlation Coefficient ({ICC}), Median Odds Ratio ({MOR}), Proportional Change in Variance ({PCV}), and deviance were used for model fitness and comparison. The multilevel logistic regression model was fitted to identify determinants of modern contraceptive use in the region. Adjusted Odds Ratio with its 95\% Confidence Interval was presented, and variables with a p-value ≤of 0.05 were declared significant determinants of modern contraceptive utilization. Results Overall, about 20.68\% (95\%{CI}:-20.46.,20.91)of women used modern contraceptive, ranging from 9.08\% in Mozambique to 61.49\% in Comoros. In the multilevel logistic regression model; maternal age group 25–34 ({AOR}: 0.79, 95\%{CI}:0.76,0.82) and 35–49 ({AOR}:0.49, 95\%{CI}:0.46,0.51). Being married ({AOR}:0.85, 95\%{CI}:0.82,0.88), mothers with primary education ({AOR}:1.48, 95\%{CI}:1.43,1.54) and secondary and above education level ({AOR}:1.60, 95\%{CI}:1.52,1.69), husbands with primary education ({AOR}:2.43, 95\%{CI}:2.35,2.51) and secondary and above education level ({AOR}:2.92, 95\%{CI}:2.76,3.05). The mothers who had occupation ({AOR}:2.11, 95\%{CI}:1.23,1.33), mothers from households with middle wealth index ({AOR}:1.23, 95\%{CI}:1.19,1.28) and rich wealth index ({AOR}:1.28, 95\%{CI}:1.23,1.33) were found to be significant determinants of modern contraceptive use. Conclusion We found that modern contraceptive utilization in the 12 East Africa countries was low compared to {SDG} target 2030(75\%). The governmental and non-governmental organizations should scale up their public health programs to the poor and marginalized communities to scale up modern contraceptive utilization uptake in the region. In addition, reforming the health system and reproductive health education through mass media to create awareness of modern contraceptive use benefits are effective strategies to improve modern contraceptive use among East Africa women.},

	shorttitle = {Does economic growth reduce childhood stunting?},
	abstract = {Background There is mixed evidence and lack of consensus on the impact of economic development on stunting, and likewise there is a dearth of empirical studies on this relationship in the case of sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, this paper examines whether economic growth is associated with childhood stunting in low-income and middle-income sub-Saharan African countries.
Methods We analysed data from 89 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 1987 and 2016 available as of October 2018 using multivariable multilevel logistic regression models to show the association between gross domestic product ({GDP}) per capita and stunting. We adjusted the models for child’s age, survey year, child’s sex, birth order and country random effect, and presented adjusted and unadjusted {ORs}.
Results We included data from 490 526 children. We found that the prevalence of stunting decreased with increasing {GDP} per capita (correlation coefficient=−0.606, p{\textless}0.0001). In the unadjusted model for full sample, for every {US}\$1000 increase in {GDP} per capita, the odds of stunting decreased by 23\% ({OR}=0.77, 95\% {CI} 0.76 to 0.78). The magnitude of the association between {GDP} per capita and stunting was stronger among children in the richest quintile. After adjustment was made, the association was not significant among children from the poorest quintile. However, the magnitude of the association was more pronounced among children from low-income countries, such that, in the model adjusted for child’s age, survey year, child’s sex, birth order and country random effect, the association between {GDP} per capita and stunting remained statistically significant; for every {US}\$1000 increase in {GDP} per capita, the odds of stunting decreased by 12\% ({OR}=0.88, 95\% {CI} 0.87 to 0.90).
Conclusion There was no significant association between economic growth and child nutritional status. The prevalence of stunting decreased with increasing {GDP} per capita. This was more pronounced among children from the richest quintile. The magnitude of the association was higher among children from low-income countries, suggesting that households in the poorest quintile were typically the least likely to benefit from economic gains. The findings could serve as a building block needed to modify current policy as per child nutrition-related programmes in Africa.},

We sought to investigate the prevalence and determinants of unintended pregnancies among women in sub-Saharan Africa. Materials and methods The study pooled data from current Demographic and Health Surveys ({DHS}) conducted from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2016 from 29 countries in {SSA}. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the factors that influence unintended pregnancies in {SSA}. Results were presented using odds ratios ({OR}). Results We found overall unintended pregnancy prevalence rate of 29\%, ranging from 10.8\% in Nigeria to 54.5\% in Namibia. As compared to women aged 15–19 years, women of all other age categories had higher odds of unintended pregnancies. Married women were 6 times more probable to report unintended pregnancy as compared to women who had never married ({OR} = 6.29, {CI} = 5.65–7.01). The phenomenon had higher odds among rural residents as compared to urban residents ({OR} = 1.08, {CI} = 1.01–1.16). Women with primary ({OR} = 0.74, {CI} = 0.69–0.80) and secondary ({OR} = 0.71, {CI} = 0.65–0.77) levels of education had less chances of unintended pregnancies, compared to those with no education. Again, women in all other wealth categories had less probability of unintended pregnancy, as compared to women with poorest wealth status. Conclusion Our study contributes substantially towards the discourse of maternal wellbeing by unveiling the prevalence and determinants of unintended pregnancy across the {SSA} region. There is the need for {SSA} countries with high prevalence of unintended pregnancies to consider past and present successful interventions of other countries within the region such as health education, counselling, skills-building, comprehensive sex education and access to contraception. Much of these efforts rest with the governments of {SSA} countries.},

	abstract = {Many standard philosophical accounts of scientific practice fail to distinguish between modeling and other types of theory construction. This failure is unfortunate because there are important contrasts among the goals, procedures, and representations employed by modelers and other kinds of theorists. We can see some of these differences intuitively when we reflect on the methods of theorists such as Vito Volterra and Linus Pauling on the one hand, and Charles Darwin and Dimitri Mendeleev on the other. Much of Volterra's and Pauling's work involved modeling; much of Darwin's and Mendeleev's did not. In order to capture this distinction, I consider two examples of theory construction in detail: Volterra's treatment of post-{WWI} fishery dynamics and Mendeleev's construction of the periodic system. I argue that modeling can be distinguished from other forms of theorizing by the procedures modelers use to represent and to study real-world phenomena: indirect representation and analysis. This differentiation between modelers and non-modelers is one component of the larger project of understanding the practice of modeling, its distinctive features, and the strategies of abstraction and idealization it employs.

	abstract = {Environmental computer models are considered essential tools in supporting environmental decision making, but their main value is that they allow a better understanding of our complex environment. Environmental models are in fact applications of shared theories on how real-world systems are functioning. Just like the underlying scientific theories they need to be evaluated and discussed among peers. To allow proper assessment of the quality and suitability of environmental models peers should be able to trace their results and insights through the model structure to the underlying choices and assumptions. This ideal of model evaluation should take place in the peer-review process before their output and the analysis of their output are published in scientific journals, but is hardly ever realized in reality. It is hypothesized that, despite the numerous attempts to promote good modeling practice and extended peer review, the reproducibility and transparency of environmental models is limited in actual terms. To test the validity of this hypothesis we have reviewed publications, documentation and software of four environmental models. We analyzed to what extent this material provided insight in the model structure and the modeling process and to what extent model findings could be traced back to the underlying choices and assumptions.},

	abstract = {A ground-up approach to explaining dynamic spatial modelling for an interdisciplinary audience. Across broad areas of the environmental and social sciences, simulation models are an important way to study systems inaccessible to scientific experimental and observational methods, and also an essential complement to those more conventional approaches. The contemporary research literature is teeming with abstract simulation models whose presentation is mathematically demanding and requires a high level of knowledge of quantitative and computational methods and approaches. Furthermore, simulation models designed to represent specific systems and phenomena are often complicated, and, as a result, difficult to reconstruct from their descriptions in the literature. This book aims to provide a practical and accessible account of dynamic spatial modelling, while also equipping readers with a sound conceptual foundation in the subject, and a useful introduction to the wide-ranging literature. Spatial Simulation: Exploring Pattern and Process is organised around the idea that a small number of spatial processes underlie the wide variety of dynamic spatial models. Its central focus on three ‘building-blocks’ of dynamic spatial models – forces of attraction and segregation, individual mobile entities, and processes of spread – guides the reader to an understanding of the basis of many of the complicated models found in the research literature. The three building block models are presented in their simplest form and are progressively elaborated and related to real world process that can be represented using them. Introductory chapters cover essential background topics, particularly the relationships between pattern, process and spatiotemporal scale. Additional chapters consider how time and space can be represented in more complicated models, and methods for the analysis and evaluation of models. Finally, the three building block models are woven together in a more elaborate example to show how a complicated model can be assembled from relatively simple components. To aid understanding, more than 50 specific models described in the book are available online at patternandprocess.org for exploration in the freely available Netlogo platform. This book encourages readers to develop intuition for the abstract types of model that are likely to be appropriate for application in any specific context. Spatial Simulation: Exploring Pattern and Process will be of interest to undergraduate and graduate students taking courses in environmental, social, ecological and geographical disciplines. Researchers and professionals who require a non-specialist introduction will also find this book an invaluable guide to dynamic spatial simulation.},

	abstract = {Ecological risk assessments of pesticides usually focus on risk at the level of individuals, and are carried out by comparing exposure and toxicological endpoints. However, in most cases the protection goal is populations rather than individuals. On the population level, effects of pesticides depend not only on exposure and toxicity, but also on factors such as life history characteristics, population structure, timing of application, presence of refuges in time and space, and landscape structure. Ecological models can integrate such factors and have the potential to become important tools for the prediction of population-level effects of exposure to pesticides, thus allowing extrapolations, for example, from laboratory to field. Indeed, a broad range of ecological models have been applied to chemical risk assessment in the scientific literature, but so far such models have only rarely been used to support regulatory risk assessments of pesticides. To better understand the reasons for this situation, the current modeling practice in this field was assessed in the present study. The scientific literature was searched for relevant models and assessed according to nine characteristics: model type, model complexity, toxicity measure, exposure pattern, other factors, taxonomic group, risk assessment endpoint, parameterization, and model evaluation. The present study found that, although most models were of a high scientific standard, many of them would need modification before they are suitable for regulatory risk assessments. The main shortcomings of currently available models in the context of regulatory pesticide risk assessments were identified. When ecological models are applied to regulatory risk assessments, we recommend reviewing these models according to the nine characteristics evaluated here. Environ. Toxicol.

They are incorporating an ever broader range of disciplines and now often confront people without strong quantitative or model-building backgrounds. These trends imply a need for wider awareness of what constitutes good model-development practice, including reporting of models to users and sceptical review of models by users. To this end the paper outlines ten basic steps of good, disciplined model practice. The aim is to develop purposeful, credible models from data and prior knowledge, in consort with end-users, with every stage open to critical review and revision. Best practice entails identifying clearly the clients and objectives of the modelling exercise; documenting the nature (quantity, quality, limitations) of the data used to construct and test the model; providing a strong rationale for the choice of model family and features (encompassing review of alternative approaches); justifying the techniques used to calibrate the model; serious analysis, testing and discussion of model performance; and making a resultant statement of model assumptions, utility, accuracy, limitations, and scope for improvement. In natural resource management applications, these steps will be a learning process, even a partnership, between model developers, clients and other interested parties.},

Analysis of these data reveals that, contrary to previous literature, the world population is unlikely to stop growing this century. There is an 80\% probability that world population, now 7.2 billion people, will increase to between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion in 2100. This uncertainty is much smaller than the range from the traditional {UN} high and low variants. Much of the increase is expected to happen in Africa, in part due to higher fertility rates and a recent slowdown in the pace of fertility decline. Also, the ratio of working-age people to older people is likely to decline substantially in all countries, even those that currently have young populations.},

	abstract = {Mortality crises are relatively common demographic events, but we know little about how they affect local populations beyond excess mortality. I argue that using a kinship perspective to study mortality crises provides valuable insights into (1) how excess mortality affects the exposure to kin loss and (2) how family bereavement may contribute to the reproduction of historical memory in the long term. I explore these two processes using a unique genealogical database that records the complete demographic history of Rio Negro, a genocide-affected population in Guatemala, between 1982 and 2015. The analysis shows that deaths from the 1982 genocide were balanced by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. One third of the population were killed, but two thirds were left bereaved (the top 10\% most affected individuals lost 30\% of their nuclear family relatives and 23\% of their extended family relatives). Notably, the proportion of the population related to a victim did not change between 1983 and 2015. The persistence of family bereavement can be interpreted as a prolongation of grief or as a driver of historical memory. These demographic dynamics have implications for the study of historical events beyond mortality crises.},

	abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) pandemic has led to a large increase in mortality in the United States and around the world, leaving many grieving the sudden loss of family members. We created an indicator—the {COVID}-19 bereavement multiplier—that estimates the average number of individuals who will experience the death of a close relative (defined as a grandparent, parent, sibling, spouse, or child) for each {COVID}-19 death. Using demographic microsimulation-based estimates of kinship networks in the United States, the clear age gradient in {COVID}-19 mortality seen across contexts, and several hypothetical infection prevalence scenarios, we estimate {COVID}-19 bereavement multipliers for White and Black individuals in the United States. Our analysis shows that for every {COVID}-19 death, approximately nine surviving Americans will lose a grandparent, parent, sibling, spouse, or child. These estimates imply, for example, that if 190,000 Americans die from {COVID}-19, as some models project, then ∼1.7 million will experience the death of a close relative. We demonstrate that our estimates of the bereavement multiplier are stable across epidemiological realities, including infection scenarios, total number of deaths, and the distribution of deaths, which means researchers can estimate the bereavement burden over the course of the epidemic in lockstep with rising death tolls. In addition, we provide estimates of bereavement multipliers by age group, types of kin loss, and race to illuminate prospective disparities. The bereavement multiplier is a useful indicator for tracking {COVID}-19’s multiplicative impact as it reverberates across American families and can be tailored to other causes of death.},

	abstract = {Close kin provide many important functions as adults age, affecting health, financial well-being, and happiness. Those without kin report higher rates of loneliness and experience elevated risks of chronic illness and nursing facility placement. Historical racial differences and recent shifts in core demographic rates suggest that white and black older adults in the United States may have unequal availability of close kin and that this gap in availability will widen in the coming decades. Whereas prior work explores the changing composition and size of the childless population or those without spouses, here we consider the kinless population of older adults with no living close family members and how this burden is changing for different race and sex groups. Using demographic microsimulation and the United States Census Bureau’s recent national projections of core demographic rates by race, we examine two definitions of kinlessness: those without a partner or living children, and those without a partner, children, siblings, or parents. Our results suggest dramatic growth in the size of the kinless population as well as increasing racial disparities in percentages kinless. These conclusions are driven by declines in marriage and are robust to different assumptions about the future trajectory of divorce rates or growth in nonmarital partnerships. Our findings draw attention to the potential expansion of older adult loneliness, which is increasingly considered a threat to population health, and the unequal burden kinlessness may place on black Americans.},

We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for {COVID}-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider the age composition of local and national contexts as well as intergenerational interactions.

Neonatal mortality rates ({NMRs}) in countries of low and middle income have been only slowly decreasing; coverage of essential maternal and newborn health services needs to increase, particularly for disadvantaged populations. Our aim was to produce comparable estimates of changes in socioeconomic inequalities in {NMR} in the past two decades across these countries.
Methods
We used data from Demographic and Health Surveys ({DHS}) for countries in which a survey was done in 2008 or later and one about 10 years previously. We measured absolute inequalities with the slope index of inequality and relative inequalities with the relative index of inequality. We used an asset-based wealth index and maternal education as measures of socioeconomic position and summarised inequality estimates for all included countries with random-effects meta-analysis.
Findings
24 low-income and middle-income countries were eligible for inclusion. In most countries, absolute and relative wealth-related and educational inequalities in {NMR} decreased between survey 1 and survey 2. In five countries (Cameroon, Nigeria, Malawi, Mozambique, and Uganda), the difference in {NMR} between the top and bottom of the wealth distribution was reduced by more than two neonatal deaths per 1000 livebirths per year. By contrast, wealth-related inequality increased by more than 1·5 neonatal deaths per 1000 livebirths per year in Ethiopia and Cambodia. Patterns of change in absolute and relative educational inequalities in {NMR} were similar to those of wealth-related {NMR} inequalities, although the size of educational inequalities tended to be slightly larger.
Interpretation
Socioeconomic inequality in {NMR} seems to have decreased in the past two decades in most countries of low and middle income. However, a substantial survival advantage remains for babies born into wealthier households with a high educational level, which should be considered in global efforts to further reduce {NMR}.

	abstract = {Background:
Prior work examining the association of maternal obesity and neonatal mortality indicate the presence of a positive relationship. However, regional evidence to provide insight on country-level heterogeneities within sub-Saharan Africa ({SSA}) with nationally representative datasets are non-existent.

Objective:
We aimed to determine the relationship between maternal obesity and neonatal mortality at the country level in {SSA} countries. Moreover, we also estimate regional measures of association to complement previous findings.

Methods:
Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}) data from 34 {SSA} countries conducted from 2006–2016 were used for this study. After missing data (36.9\% of cases) were addressed with multiple imputations, we identified a total of 175,860 women for the analysis. Complete case and multiply imputed datasets were analyzed individually with multilevel logistic regression models. Potential confounders adjusted for in the regression model included maternal age, level of educational attainment, area of residence, access to prenatal care, birth order and multiple birth (singleton vs twin birth). Regional and country-specific associations were computed, and unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios ({ORs}), along with the confidence intervals ({CIs}) were reported.

Findings:
Of the total study population, 8,451 (7.6\%) were obese. In the regional level analyses, maternal obesity was associated with 40\% increased odds of neonatal deaths. This finding was consistent in subgroup analyses by urban and rural residence, and geographic region of residence in {SSA}. Additionally, obese women were more likely to report neonatal death in the first week of life ({OR}, days 0–1: 1.39, 95\% {CI} 1.15–1.69; {OR}, days 2–6: 1.35, 95\% {CI} 1.02–1.79). In the individual country analyses, majority of the countries studied had central estimates supporting elevated odds of neonatal mortality, but the confidence intervals were imprecise.

Conclusion:
This study highlights the potential burden of neonatal mortality borne by obese women in {SSA}. There is, however, a need for longitudinal studies to confirm the results.},

Methods A prospective study of pregnancy outcomes was performed in 106 communities at seven sites in Argentina, Guatemala, India, Kenya, Pakistan and Zambia. Pregnant women were enrolled and followed until six weeks postpartum. Findings Between 2010 and 2012, 214 070 of 220 235 enrolled women (97.2\%) completed follow-up. The maternal mortality ratio was 168 per 100 000 live births, ranging from 69 per 100 000 in Argentina to 316 per 100 000 in Pakistan. Overall, 29\% (98/336) of maternal deaths occurred around the time of delivery: most were attributed to haemorrhage (86/336), pre-eclampsia or eclampsia (55/336) or sepsis (39/336). Around 70\% (4349/6213) of stillbirths were probably intrapartum; 34\% (1804/5230) of neonates died on the day of delivery and 14\% (755/5230) died the day after. Stillbirths were more common in women who died than in those alive six weeks postpartum (risk ratio, {RR}: 9.48; 95\% confidence interval, {CI}: 7.97–11.27), as were perinatal deaths ({RR}: 4.30; 95\% {CI}: 3.26–5.67) and 7-day ({RR}: 3.94; 95\% {CI}: 2.74–5.65) and 28-day neonatal deaths ({RR}: 7.36; 95\% {CI}: 5.54–9.77). Conclusion Most maternal, fetal and neonatal deaths occurred at or around delivery and were attributed to preventable causes. Maternal death increased the risk of perinatal and neonatal death.

The promotion of delivery with a skilled birth attendant ({SBA}) is being promoted as a strategy to reduce neonatal mortality. This study explored whether {SBAs} had a protective effect against neonatal mortality in three different regions of the world. The analysis pooled data from nine diverse countries for which recent Demographic and Health Survey data were available. Multilevel logistic regression was used to understand the influence of skilled delivery on two outcomes—neonatal mortality during the first week of life and during the first day of life. Control variables included age, parity, education, wealth, residence (urban/rural), geographic region (Africa, Asia and Latin America/Caribbean), antenatal care and tetanus immunization. The direction of the effect of skilled delivery on neonatal mortality was dependent on geographic region. While having a {SBA} at delivery was protective against neonatal mortality in Latin America/Caribbean, in Asia there was only a protective effect for births in the first week of life. In Africa {SBAs} were associated with higher neonatal mortality for both outcomes, and the same was true for deaths on the first day of life in Asia. Many women in Africa and Asia deliver at home unless a complication occurs, and thus skilled birth attendants may be seeing more women with complications than their unskilled counterparts. In addition there are issues with the definition of a {SBA} with many attendants in both Africa and Asia not actually having the needed training and equipment to prevent neonatal mortality. Considerable investment is needed in terms of training and health infrastructure to enable these providers to save the youngest lives.},

	abstract = {Background Widespread increases in facility delivery have not substantially reduced neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia over the past 2 decades. This may be due to poor quality care available in widely used primary care clinics. In this study, we examine the association between hospital delivery and neonatal mortality. Methods and findings We used an ecological study design to assess cross-sectional associations between the share of hospital delivery and neonatal mortality across country regions. Data were from the Demographic and Health Surveys from 2009 to 2018, covering 682,239 births across all regions. We assess the association between the share of facility births in a region that occurred in hospitals (versus lower-level clinics) and early (0 to 7 days) neonatal mortality per 1,000 births, controlling for potential confounders including the share of facility births, small at birth, maternal age, maternal education, urbanicity, antenatal care visits, income, region, and survey year. We examined changes in this association in different contexts of country income, global region, and urbanicity using interaction models. Across the 1,143 regions from 37 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, 42\%, 29\%, and 28\% of births took place in a hospital, clinic, and at home, respectively. A 10-percentage point higher share of facility deliveries occurring in hospitals was associated with 1.2 per 1,000 fewer deaths (p-value {\textless} 0.01; 95\% {CI}: 0.82 to 1.60), relative to mean mortality of 22. Associations were strongest in South Asian countries, middle-income countries, and urban regions. The study’s limitations include the inability to control for all confounding factors given the ecological and cross-sectional design and potential misclassification of facility levels in our data. Conclusions Regions with more hospital deliveries than clinic deliveries have reduced neonatal mortality. Increasing delivery in hospitals while improving quality across the health system may help to reduce high neonatal mortality.},

	abstract = {Under-five child mortality declined 47\% since 2000 following the implementation of the United Nation's ({UN}) Millennium Development Goals. To further reduce under-five child mortality, the {UN}'s Sustainable Development Goals ({SDGs}) will focus on interventions to address neonatal mortality, a major contributor of under-five mortality. The African region has the highest neonatal mortality rate (28.0 per 1000 live births), followed by that of the Eastern Mediterranean (26.6) and South-East Asia (24.3). This study used the Demographic and Health Survey Birth Recode data (http://dhsprogram.com/data/File-Types-and-Names.cfm) to identify high-risk districts and countries for neonatal mortality in two sub-regions of Africa - East Africa and West Africa. Geographically weighted Poisson regression models were estimated to capture the spatially varying relationships between neonatal mortality and dimensions of potential need i) care around the time of delivery, ii) maternal education, and iii) women's empowerment. In East Africa, neonatal mortality was significantly associated with home births, mothers without an education and mothers whose husbands decided on contraceptive practices, controlling for rural residency. In West Africa, neonatal mortality was also significantly associated with home births, mothers with a primary education and mothers who did not want or plan their last child. Importantly, neonatal mortality associated with home deliveries were explained by maternal exposure to unprotected water sources in East Africa and older maternal age and female sex of infants in West Africa. Future {SDG}-interventions may target these dimensions of need in priority high-risk districts and countries, to further reduce the burden of neonatal mortality in Africa.},

	abstract = {Objectives Process evaluation has become the mainstay of safe motherhood evaluation in developing countries, yet the extent to which indicators measuring access to obstetric services at the population level reflect levels of maternal mortality is uncertain. In this study we examine the association between population indicators of access to obstetric care and levels of maternal mortality in urban and rural West Africa. Methods In this ecological study we used data on maternal mortality and access to obstetric services from two population-based studies conducted in 16 sites in eight West African countries: the Maternal Mortality and Obstetric Care in West Africa ({MAMOCWA}) study in rural Sénégal, Guinea-Bissau and The Gambia and the Morbidité Maternelle en Afrique de l'Ouest ({MOMA}) study in urban Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Mauritanie, Niger and Sénégal. Results In rural areas, maternal mortality, excluding early pregnancy deaths, was 601 per 100 000 live births, compared with 241 per 100 000 for urban areas [{RR} = 2.49 ({CI} 1.77–3.59)]. In urban areas, the vast majority of births took place in a health facility (83\%) or with a skilled provider (69\%), while 80\% of the rural women gave birth at home without any skilled care. There was a relatively close link between levels of maternal mortality and the percentage of births with a skilled attendant (r = −0.65), in hospital (r = −0.54) or with a Caesarean section (r = −0.59), with marked clustering in urban and rural areas. Within urban or rural areas, none of the process indicators were associated with maternal mortality. Conclusion Despite the limitations of this ecological study, there can be little doubt that the huge rural–urban differences in maternal mortality are due, at least in part, to differential access to high quality maternity care. Whether any of the indicators examined here will by themselves be good enough as a proxy for maternal mortality is doubtful however, as more than half of the variation in mortality remained unexplained by any one of them.},

A systematic literature review identified studies documenting the factors associated with {FBD}, stratified by region. Rates of skilled birth attendance, facility delivery, maternal mortality, and early neonatal mortality were compared across nations and regions. 70 articles met inclusion criteria, reflecting wide variability in the number, type, and quality of studies by region. Within-country differences were most pronounced in nations where multiple studies were conducted. Correlation between {FBD} and maternal mortality rates throughout {SSA} was -0.69 (p=.008), and the correlation between facility delivery rates and early neonatal mortality rates was -0.41 (p=0.08).

	abstract = {Informal health providers ranging from drug vendors to traditional healers account for a large fraction of health care provision in developing countries. They are, however, largely unlicensed and unregulated leading to concern that they provide ineffective and, in some cases, even harmful care. A new and controversial policy tool that has been proposed to alter household health seeking behavior is an outright ban on these informal providers. The theoretical effects of such a ban are ambiguous. In this paper, we study the effect of a ban on informal (traditional) birth attendants imposed by the Malawi government in 2007. To measure the effect of the ban, we use a difference-in-difference strategy exploiting variation across time and space in the intensity of exposure to the ban. Our most conservative estimates suggest that the ban decreased use of traditional attendants by about 15 percentage points. Approximately three quarters of this decline can be attributed to an increase in use of the formal sector and the remainder is accounted for by an increase in relative/friend-attended births. Despite the rather large shift from the informal to the formal sector, we do not find any evidence of a statistically significant reduction in newborn mortality on average. The results are robust to a triple difference specification using young children as a control group. We examine several explanations for this result and find evidence consistent with quality of formal care acting as a constraint on improvements in newborn health.},

Although grief is not a disease and most people adjust without professional psychological intervention, bereavement is associated with excess risk of mortality, particularly in the early weeks and months after loss. It is related to decrements in physical health, indicated by presence of symptoms and illnesses, and use of medical services. Furthermore, bereaved individuals report diverse psychological reactions. For a few people, mental disorders or complications in the grieving process ensue. We summarise research on risk factors that increase vulnerability of some bereaved individuals. Diverse factors (circumstances of death, intrapersonal and interpersonal variables, ways of coping) are likely to co-determine excesses in ill-health. We also assess the effectiveness of psychological intervention programmes. Intervention should be targeted at high-risk people and those with complicated grief or bereavement-related depression and stress disorders.},

	abstract = {Provocative studies have reported that in the United States, marriages producing firstborn daughters are more likely to divorce than those producing firstborn sons. The findings have been interpreted as contemporary evidence of fathers’ son preference. Our study explores the potential role of another set of dynamics that may drive these patterns: namely, selection into live birth. Epidemiological evidence indicates that the characteristic female survival advantage may begin before birth. If stress accompanying unstable marriages has biological effects on fecundity, a female survival advantage could generate an association between stability and the sex composition of offspring. Combining regression and simulation techniques to analyze real-world data, we ask, How much of the observed association between sex of the firstborn child and risk of divorce could plausibly be accounted for by the joint effects of female survival advantage and reduced fecundity associated with unstable marriage? Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth ({NLSY}79), we find that relationship conflict predicts the sex of children born after conflict was measured; conflict also predicts subsequent divorce. Conservative specification of parameters linking pregnancy characteristics, selection into live birth, and divorce are sufficient to generate a selection-driven association between offspring sex and divorce, which is consequential in magnitude. Our findings illustrate the value of demographic accounting of processes which occur before birth—a period when many outcomes of central interest in the population sciences begin to take shape.},

Arguing that child-bearing patterns in both kinds of societies are based on rational decisions, Caldwell concludes that, in the course of the coming century, fertility will almost certainly fall to low levels in most societies--even where economic growth has been slow and per capita incomes remain low--because of the massive social change leading to the nucleated family structure found in the West.},

This study focuses on monitoring the dynamic changes of air quality effectively in large cities by analyzing the spatiotemporal trends in geo-targeted social media messages with comprehensive big data filtering procedures. We introduce a new social media analytic framework to (1) investigate the relationship between air pollution topics posted in Sina Weibo (Chinese Twitter) and the daily Air Quality Index ({AQI}) published by China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection; and (2) monitor the dynamics of air quality index by using social media messages. Correlation analysis was used to compare the connections between discussion trends in social media messages and the temporal changes in the {AQI} during 2012. We categorized relevant messages into three types, retweets, mobile app messages, and original individual messages finding that original individual messages had the highest correlation to the Air Quality Index. Based on this correlation analysis, individual messages were used to monitor the {AQI} in 2013. Our study indicates that the filtered social media messages are strongly correlated to the {AQI} and can be used to monitor the air quality dynamics to some extent.},

	abstract = {Studies on the health effects of long-term average exposure to outdoor air pollution have played an important role in recent health impact assessments. Exposure assessment for epidemiological studies of long-term exposure to ambient air pollution remains a difficult challenge because of substantial small-scale spatial variation. Current approaches for assessing intra-urban air pollution contrasts include the use of exposure indicator variables, interpolation methods, dispersion models and land-use regression ({LUR}) models. {LUR} models have been increasingly used in the past few years. This paper provides a critical review of the different components of {LUR} models. We identified 25 land-use regression studies. Land-use regression combines monitoring of air pollution at typically 20–100 locations, spread over the study area, and development of stochastic models using predictor variables usually obtained through geographic information systems ({GIS}). Monitoring is usually temporally limited: one to four surveys of typically one or two weeks duration. Significant predictor variables include various traffic representations, population density, land use, physical geography (e.g. altitude) and climate. Land-use regression methods have generally been applied successfully to model annual mean concentrations of {NO}2, {NOx}, {PM}2.5, the soot content of {PM}2.5 and {VOCs} in different settings, including European and North-American cities. The performance of the method in urban areas is typically better or equivalent to geo-statistical methods, such as kriging, and dispersion models. Further developments of the land-use regression method include more focus on developing models that can be transferred to other areas, inclusion of additional predictor variables such as wind direction or emission data and further exploration of focalsum methods. Models that include a spatial and a temporal component are of interest for (e.g. birth cohort) studies that need exposure variables on a finer temporal scale. There is a strong need for validation of {LUR} models with personal exposure monitoring.},

A {GIS} was also established, containing data on monitored air pollution levels, road network, traffic volume, land cover, altitude and other, locally determined, features. Data from 80 of the monitoring sites were then used to construct a regression equation, on the basis of predictor environmental variables, and the resulting equation used to map air pollution across the study area. The accuracy of the map was then assessed by comparing predicted pollution levels with monitored levels at a range of independent reference sites. Results showed that the map produced extremely good predictions of monitored pollution levels, both for individual surveys and for the mean annual concentration, with r2 0.79-0.87 across 8-10 reference points, though the accuracy of predictions for individual survey periods was more variable. In Huddersfield and Amsterdam, further monitoring also showed that the pollution map provided reliable estimates of {NO}2 concentrations in the following year (r2 0.59-0.86 for n 20).},

Yet who and what defines and makes a population has everything to do with whether population means are meaningful or meaningless, with profound implications for work on population health and health inequities. Methods: In this article, I review the current conventional definitions of, and historical debates over, the meaning(s) of “population,” trace back the contemporary emphasis on populations as statistical rather than substantive entities to Adolphe Quetelet's powerful astronomical metaphor, conceived in the 1830s, of l’homme moyen (the average man), and argue for an alternative definition of populations as relational beings. As informed by the ecosocial theory of disease distribution, I then analyze several case examples to explore the utility of critical population-informed thinking for research, knowledge, and policy involving population health and health inequities. Findings: Four propositions emerge: (1) the meaningfulness of means depends on how meaningfully the populations are defined in relation to the inherent intrinsic and extrinsic dynamic generative relationships by which they are constituted; (2) structured chance drives population distributions of health and entails conceptualizing health and disease, including biomarkers, as embodied phenotype and health inequities as historically contingent; (3) persons included in population health research are study participants, and the casual equation of this term with “study population” should be avoided; and (4) the conventional cleavage of “internal validity” and “generalizability” is misleading, since a meaningful choice of study participants must be in relation to the range of exposures experienced (or not) in the real-world societies, that is, meaningful populations, of which they are a part. Conclusions: To improve conceptual clarity, causal inference, and action to promote health equity, population sciences need to expand and deepen their theorizing about who and what makes populations and their means.},

	abstract = {Background
              Progress in reducing malaria incidence and deaths has stalled, in part due to limited access to quality malaria testing and treatment amongst rural populations. This time-series analysis aims to describe changes in rural malaria diagnosis and treatment before and during the rollout of Liberia’s National Community Health Assistant ({CHA}) program. It also explores how malaria service delivery changed during the {COVID}-19 epidemic.
            
            
              Methods
              Malaria diagnosis and treatment data from 315 rural health facility catchments supported by Liberia’s National {CHA} Program were collected from Liberia’s Health Management Information System and analyzed. Trends in malaria service delivery coverage and quality were assessed between January 2011 and December 2020.
            
            
              Results
              By 2020, four years after the program’s introduction, Liberia’s Community Health Assistants diagnosed 50\% of rapid diagnostic test ({RDT}) or microscopy-confirmed malaria cases and carried out 51\% of malaria treatments amongst children under age five in rural areas where {CHAs} were present. Furthermore, the percentage of malaria diagnoses that were confirmed by microscopy or {RDT} increased from 71\% prior to the program to 95\% in 2020. These results were effectively sustained in rural and remote communities during {COVID}-19 in 2020.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The introduction of Liberia’s {CHA} program was associated with improvements in the quality of malaria diagnoses and contributed to treating a significant share of the malaria burden amongst children under age five in remote rural communities across Liberia, and these improvements were sustained during {COVID}-19. Investments made in rural community health systems can be leveraged by policy makers to strengthen malaria diagnosis, treatment and control, especially in the age of {COVID}-19.},

	abstract = {Background It is widely accepted that maternal healthcare is vital for improving maternal and neonatal mortality rates. Furthermore, the continuum of care–the integrated delivery of antenatal, delivery and postnatal care–has been shown to be particularly important. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest neonatal and maternal mortality rates in the world; significant improvements in the provision and utilisation of the continuum are urgently needed, therefore the barriers preventing access need to be better understood. This study aimed to identify key factors associated with the utilisation of maternal healthcare, in the Mchinji District of Malawi. Methods 4,244 pregnant women from the Mchinji District of Malawi were interviewed between March and December 2013. The overall utilisation of maternal healthcare was calculated by combining the use of antenatal, delivery and postnatal care into one variable—continuum of care. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to determine the factors associated with utilisation of maternal healthcare. Results Utilisation of maternal healthcare in the Mchinji District was inadequate; only 24\% of women received the recommended package. Being further from a healthcare facility ({OR} = 0.2, 95\%{CI} = 0.04–0.96), having at least one live child ({OR} = 0.87, 95\%{CI} = 0.84–0.99), previous experience of miscarriage ({OR} = 0.64, 95\%{CI} = 0.50–0.82) or abuse ({OR} = 0.81, 95\%{CI} = 0.69–0.95) reduced utilisation, whereas being in the richest 20\% ({OR} = 1.33 95\%{CI} = 1.08–1.65), having a planned pregnancy ({OR} = 1.3, 95\%{CI} = 1.11–1.51) or more control over decisions ({OR} = 1.09, 95\%{CI} = 0.80–1.49) increased utilisation. Conclusion Seven groups of women were identified as having an increased risk of low utilisation of maternal healthcare; women living {\textgreater}5km from a healthcare facility, within the poorest socio-economic group, experiencing an unplanned pregnancy, with at least one live child, experience of a previous miscarriage, no control over their healthcare decisions or experience of abuse. Policy makers should pay extra attention to these high-risk groups when designing and delivering strategies to improve maternal healthcare utilisation.},

This is that individuals should respond to lower (higher) infant mortality of socially proximate others with decreased (increased) fertility. On a more general level this problem directly concerns the translation of the effects of macro-demographic forces such as mortality into micro-level individual behavior through social interaction. Using unique data that combine identification of individuals belonging to women's social networks with direct measurement of these network members' mortality experience, this research demonstrates such a linkage. Information concerning the level and variation in infant mortality available to women from a small Nepalese mountain population in their social networks is seen to influence the tempo of their fertility. It is suggested that the methodology employed has important implications for quantitative analyses of reciprocal processes of social construction and micro-macro linkages more generally.},

Using nationally representative survey data from 13 West and Central African countries, we estimate multilevel discrete-time hazard models to determine how women’s risk of intimate partner violence ({IPV}) varies with the death of children. We assess heterogeneity in this association across two surrounding circumstances: children’s age at death and regional prevalence of child bereavement. Findings indicate that the risk of {IPV} initiation rises with the death of children under age 5—for whom women are most intensely responsible—but not with the death of older children. The effect of young child bereavement is most pronounced in regions where it is least prevalent among mothers—a finding not explained by concomitant regional variation in gender inequality, family norms, and infrastructural development. These findings highlight the importance of child mortality for family outcomes beyond fertility in the African context and demonstrate the prominent role of the broader mortality context in shaping these implications.},

	abstract = {The relationship between mortality and fertility is a key component of demographic transition theory, placing it at the center of extensive inquiry. Among other linkages, mortality in women's communities and social networks influences their subsequent fertility. Existing demographic research assumes this is principally due to volitional mechanisms, implying that exposure to mortality consolidates women's desire to become pregnant, leading to intended fertility. Yet, insights from other disciplines suggest that mortality exposure could also increase women's unintended fertility through psychological, relational, and behavioral mechanisms. This study examines the relationships between network mortality exposure and women's hazard of pregnancy, and of unintended pregnancy specifically. We analyze two years (2009–2011) of closely spaced panel data on young Malawian women (N=1,272) enrolled in the Tsogolo la Thanzi study. Our data include information on funeral attendance and fertility desires measured weeks before conception, which is confirmed through frequent pregnancy testing. Hazard models show that the number of funerals women attend corresponds with a higher hazard of pregnancy and of unintended pregnancy specifically. These findings make clear that mortality exposure can influence fertility not by shaping women's desires but by disrupting the realization of those desires.},

The least-studied familial relationship in the bereavement literature is that of siblings, although loss of a sibling may also involve health consequences. The authors conducted a follow-up study based on data from the Swedish total population register, covering the period 1981–2002. Using Cox regression, mortality risk ratios for bereaved and nonbereaved persons aged 18–69 years were estimated. All-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality (unnatural causes, natural causes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, suicide, accidents, and all other causes) were examined. In men, the mortality risk for bereaved persons versus nonbereaved persons was 1.26 (95\% confidence interval: 1.22, 1.30), and in women it was 1.33 (95\% confidence interval: 1.28, 1.39). An elevated mortality risk associated with a sibling's death was found in all age groups studied, but the association was generally stronger at younger ages and could be observed predominantly after more than 1 year of follow-up. There was also an increased mortality risk if the sibling had died from a discordant main cause, which may strengthen the possibility that the association observed is not due to confounding alone.},

More importantly what is antenatal care? This review found that questions have been raised about the impact of antenatal care (specifically on maternal mortality) since its inception in developed countries, and that although the questions continue to be asked there is very little research trying to find answers. Many antenatal procedures are essentially screening tests yet it was found that there were very few results showing sensitivity and specificity, and that they rarely complied with the established criteria for the effectiveness of a screening test. The acknowledged gold standard measurement of effectiveness is the randomized controlled trial, yet the only results available referred to nutritional supplementation. This service of flawed methodology has been exported to developing countries and is being promoted by {WHO} and other agencies. This paper argues that there is insufficient evidence to reach a firm decision about the effectiveness of antenatal care, yet there is sufficient evidence to cast doubt on the possible effect of antenatal care. Research is urgently required in order to identify those procedures which ought to be included in the antenatal process. In the final analysis the greatest impact will be achieved by developing a domiciliary midwifery service supported by appropriate local efficient obstetric services. That this domiciliary service should provide care for women in pregnancy is not disputed but the specific nature of this care needs considerable clarification},

	abstract = {In this second article of the neonatal survival series, we identify 16 interventions with proven efficacy (implementation under ideal conditions) for neonatal survival and combine them into packages for scaling up in health systems, according to three service delivery modes (outreach, family-community, and facility-based clinical care). All the packages of care are cost effective compared with single interventions. Universal (99\%) coverage of these interventions could avert an estimated 41–72\% of neonatal deaths worldwide. At 90\% coverage, intrapartum and postnatal packages have similar effects on neonatal mortality—two-fold to three-fold greater than that of antenatal care. However, running costs are two-fold higher for intrapartum than for postnatal care. A combination of universal—ie, for all settings—outreach and family-community care at 90\% coverage averts 18–37\% of neonatal deaths. Most of this benefit is derived from family-community care, and greater effect is seen in settings with very high neonatal mortality. Reductions in neonatal mortality that exceed 50\% can be achieved with an integrated, high-coverage programme of universal outreach and family-community care, consisting of 12\% and 26\%, respectively, of total running costs, plus universal facility-based clinical services, which make up 62\% of the total cost. Early success in averting neonatal deaths is possible in settings with high mortality and weak health systems through outreach and family-community care, including health education to improve home-care practices, to create demand for skilled care, and to improve care seeking. Simultaneous expansion of clinical care for babies and mothers is essential to achieve the reduction in neonatal deaths needed to meet the Millennium Development Goal for child survival.

We then go on to discuss strategies that complement intrapartum care. We conclude by discussing the inexplicable hesitation in decision-making after nearly 20 years of safe motherhood programming: if the fifth Millennium Development Goal is to be achieved, then what needs to be prioritised is obvious.

Some developed and transitional countries have managed to reduce their maternal mortality during the past 25 years. Few of these, however, began with the very high rates that are now estimated for the poorest countries—in which further progress is jeopardised by weak health systems, continuing high fertility, and poor availability of data. Maternal deaths are clustered around labour, delivery, and the immediate postpartum period, with obstetric haemorrhage being the main medical cause of death. Local variation can be important, with unsafe abortion carrying huge risk in some populations, and {HIV}/{AIDS} becoming a leading cause of death where {HIV}-related mortaliy rates are high. Inequalities in the risk of maternal death exist everywhere. Targeting of interventions to the most vulnerable—rural populations and poor people—is essential if substantial progress is to be achieved by 2015.},

	abstract = {Background
We undertook a multicentre randomized controlled trial that compared the standard model of antenatal care with a new model that emphasises actions known to be effective in improving maternal or neonatal outcomes and has fewer clinic visits.
Methods
Clinics in Argentina, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand were randomly allocated to provide either the new model (27 clinics) or the standard model currently in use (26 clinics). All women presenting for antenatal care at these clinics over an average of 18 months were enrolled. Women enrolled in clinics offering the new model were classified on the basis of history of obstetric and clinical conditions. Those who did not require further specific assessment or treatment were offered the basic component of the new model, and those deemed at higher risk received the usual care for their conditions; however, all were included in the new-model group for the analyses, which were by intention to treat. The primary outcomes were low birthweight ({\textless}2500 g), preeclampsia/eclampsia, severe postpartum anaemia ({\textless}90 g/L haemoglobin), and treated urinary-tract infection. There was an assessment of quality of care and an economic evaluation.
Findings
Women attending clinics assigned the new model (n=12 568) had a median of five visits compared with eight within the standard model (n=11 958). More women in the new model than in the standard model were referred to higher levels of care (13·4\% vs 7·3\%), but rates of hospital admission, diagnosis, and length of stay were similar. The groups had similar rates of low birthweight (new model 7·68\% vs standard model 7·14\%; stratified rate difference 0·96 [95\% {CI} −0·01 to 1·92]), postpartum anaemia (7·59\% vs 8·67\%; 0·32), and urinary-tract infection (5·95\% vs 7·41\%; −0·42 [−1·65 to 0·80]). For pre-eclampsia/eclampsia the rate was slightly higher in the new model (1·69\% vs 1·38\%; 0·21 [−0·25 to 0·67]). Adjustment by several confounding variables did not modify this pattern. There were negligible differences between groups for several secondary outcomes. Women and providers in both groups were, in general, satisfied with the care received, although some women assigned the new model expressed concern about the timing of visits. There was no cost increase, and in some settings the new model decreased cost.
Interpretation
Provision of routine antenatal care by the new model seems not to affect maternal and perinatal outcomes. It could be implemented without major resistance from women and providers and may reduce cost.},

Two constructions are: singleton and batch adaptive sampling. In singleton sampling, locations xi are chosen sequentially and at each stage, xk+1 depends on data obtained at locations x1,…,xk. In batch sampling, locations are chosen in batches of size b{\textgreater}1, allowing each new batch, \{x(k+1),…,x(k+b)\}, to depend on data obtained at locations x1,…,xkb. In most settings, batch sampling is more realistic than singleton sampling. We propose specific batch {AGDs} and assess their efficiency relative to their singleton adaptive and non-adaptive counterparts using simulations. We then show how we are applying these findings to inform an {AGD} of a rolling Malaria Indicator Survey, part of a large-scale, five-year malaria transmission reduction project in Malawi.},

	abstract = {A national {HIV}/{AIDS} and malaria parasitological survey was carried out in Tanzania in 2007–2008. In this study the parasitological data were analyzed: i) to identify climatic/environmental, socio-economic and interventions factors associated with child malaria risk and ii) to produce a contemporary, high spatial resolution parasitaemia risk map of the country. Bayesian geostatistical models were fitted to assess the association between parasitaemia risk and its determinants. Bayesian kriging was employed to predict malaria risk at unsampled locations across Tanzania and to obtain the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) simulation methods were employed for model fit and prediction. Parasitaemia risk estimates were linked to population data and the number of infected children at province level was calculated. Model validation indicated a high predictive ability of the geostatistical model, with 60.00\% of the test locations within the 95\% credible interval. The results indicate that older children are significantly more likely to test positive for malaria compared with younger children and living in urban areas and better-off households reduces the risk of infection. However, none of the environmental and climatic proxies or the intervention measures were significantly associated with the risk of parasitaemia. Low levels of malaria prevalence were estimated for Zanzibar island. The population-adjusted prevalence ranges from in Kaskazini province (Zanzibar island) to in Mtwara region. The pattern of predicted malaria risk is similar with the previous maps based on historical data, although the estimates are lower. The predicted maps could be used by decision-makers to allocate resources and target interventions in the regions with highest burden of malaria in order to reduce the disease transmission in the country.},

How a given number of people, in a given location and with varying population characteristics may exacerbate or mitigate the impacts of climate change or how, conversely, they may be vulnerable to climate change impacts are basic questions that remain largely unresolved [6]. This paper explores where and to what extent population dynamics intersect with high exposure to climate change. Specifically, in Eastern Africa's Lake Victoria Basin ({LVB}), a climate change/health vulnerability hotspot we have identified in prior research [7], we model child undernutrition vulnerability indices based on climate variables, including proxy measures ({NDVI}) derived from satellite imagery, at a 5-km spatial resolution.

	shorttitle = {Sources of variation in under-5 mortality across sub-Saharan Africa},
	abstract = {Background
Detailed spatial understanding of levels and trends in under-5 mortality is needed to improve the targeting of interventions to the areas of highest need, and to understand the sources of variation in mortality. To improve this understanding, we analysed local-level information on child mortality across sub-Saharan Africa between 1980–2010.
Methods
We used data from 82 Demographic and Health Surveys in 28 sub-Saharan African countries, including the location and timing of 3·24 million childbirths and 393 685 deaths, to develop high-resolution spatial maps of under-5 mortality in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. These estimates were at a resolution of 0·1 degree latitude by 0·1 degree longitude (roughly 10 km × 10 km). We then analysed this spatial information to distinguish within-country versus between-country sources of variation in mortality, to examine the extent to which declines in mortality have been accompanied by convergence in the distribution of mortality, and to study localised drivers of mortality differences, including temperature, malaria burden, and conflict.
Findings
In our sample of sub-Saharan African countries from the 1980s to the 2000s, within-country differences in under-5 mortality accounted for 74–78\% of overall variation in under-5 mortality across space and over time. Mortality differed significantly across only 8–15\% of country borders, supporting the role of local, rather than national, factors in driving mortality patterns. We found that by the end of the study period, 23\% of the eligible children in the study countries continue to live in mortality hotspots—areas where, if current trends continue, the Sustainable Developent Goals mortality targets will not be met. In multivariate analysis, within-country mortality levels at each pixel were significantly related to local temperature, malaria burden, and recent history of conflict.
Interpretation
Our findings suggest that sub-national determinants explain a greater portion of under-5 mortality than do country-level characteristics. Sub-national measures of child mortality could provide a more accurate, and potentially more actionable, portrayal of where and why children are still dying than can national statistics.

	abstract = {Essential maternity care services include providing antenatal, delivery and postnatal care in a continuum to avert excess maternal deaths. This study assesses whether there is any significant difference in the utilization of maternal healthcare services between women from households that experienced any maternal death and women from households that did not experience any maternal death. Data from India’s District Level Households and Facility Survey, 2007–08 were used. A sample of 321 women (unweighted) aged 15–49 years residing in households that had experienced maternal death, and 217 737 women (unweighted) of the same age group living in households that did not experience any maternal death were found eligible for the analysis. Results indicate that women belonging to households that experienced maternal deaths were less likely to opt for full antenatal care [odds ratio ({OR}): 0.56; 95\% confidence interval ({CI}): 0.35–0.88] and postnatal care ({OR}: 0.82; 95\% {CI}: 0.61–0.91) compared with women from households that did not experience any maternal death. Conversely, women belonging to households experiencing maternal deaths were more likely to utilize skilled birth attendants ({OR}: 1.31; 95\% {CI}: 1.03–1.73) for their last delivery. This study hopes to draw the attention of program and policy makers to improve the reach of antenatal and postnatal care services, which are considered to be a supply side barrier compared with institutional delivery even by households that have reported maternal death.},

	abstract = {Background Studies have often ignored examining the role of community- and district-level factors in the utilization of maternity healthcare services, particularly in Indian contexts. The Social Determinants of Health framework emphasizes the role of governance and government policies, the measures for which are rarely incorporated in single-level individual analysis. This study examines factors associated with maternal healthcare utilization in nine high focus states in India, which shares more than half of the total maternal deaths in the country; accounting for individual-, household-, community- and district-level characteristics.Methods The required data are extracted from the third round of the nationally representative District Level Household and Facility Survey conducted during 2007–08. Multilevel analyses were applied to three maternity outcomes, namely, four or more antenatal care visits, skilled birth attendance and post-natal care after birth.Findings Results show that along with individual-/household-level factors, community and district-level factors influence the pattern of utilization of maternal healthcare services significantly. At the community level, the odds of maternal healthcare utilization were lower in rural areas and in communities with a high concentration of poor and illiterate women. Moreover, the average population coverage of primary health centres ({PHCs}), availability of labour room in {PHC} and percentage of registered pregnancies were significant factors at the district level that influenced the use of maternity care services. The study also found a strong association between the extent of previous use of maternal healthcare and its effect on subsequent usage patterns.Conclusion This study highlights the role of strengthening public health infrastructure at district level in the study area, and promoting awareness about available healthcare services and subsidized schemes in the community. To reach out to rural and underprivileged communities and to apply a participatory approach from the programme officials are issues to delve into.},

We use nationally representative data from the high-mortality context of Peru to examine whether the desire to have a(nother) child varies as a function of sibling loss and to assess heterogeneity in this association by women’s current number of children and a range of conditions related to siblings’ deaths. Women who have experienced sibling bereavement and have two or more children report higher odds of desiring another child. These effects are not contingent on the age or sex of the deceased sibling but are only significant if the sibling died during the respondent’s lifetime (not before).

Given that survey errors can significantly influence estimates and invalidate study findings, it is crucial that the fieldwork progress is closely monitored to ensure data quality. The objective of this study was to describe the fieldwork monitoring conducted during the first Portuguese National Health Examination Survey ({INSEF}) regarding protocol deviations and key performance indicators ({KPI}). \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} Data derived from interviewer observation and from the statistical quality control of selected {KPI} were used to monitor the four components of the {INSEF} survey (recruitment, physical examination, blood collection and health questionnaire). Survey {KPI} included response rate, average time distribution for procedures, distribution of the last digit in a specific measure, proportion of haemolysed blood samples and missing values. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} Interviewer observation identified deviations from the established protocols, which were promptly corrected. During fieldwork monitoring through {KPI}, upon implementation of corrective measures, the participation rate increased 2.5-fold, and a 4.4-fold decrease in non-adherence to standardized survey procedures was observed in the average time distribution for blood pressure measurement. The proportion of measurements with the terminal digit of 0 or 5 decreased to 19.6 and 16.5\%, respectively, after the pilot study. The proportion of haemolysed samples was at baseline level, below 2.5\%. Missing data issues were minimized by promptly communicating them to the interviewer, who could recontact the participant and fill in the missing information. \textbf{\textit{Discussion/Conclusion:}} Although the majority of the deviations from the established protocol occurred during the first weeks of the fieldwork, our results emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring of survey {KPI} to ensure data quality throughout the survey.},

In face-to-face surveys, item nonresponse is influenced by interviewers. Although interviewers are trained to conduct standardized interviews, some obtain a higher number of item nonresponses than others. This study examines interviewer effects on nonresponse to questions about household income, bank balances, and interest and dividend income in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe ({SHARE}). It first investigates the extent to which interviewers affect nonresponse to income and asset questions and second whether interviewers’ prior expectations regarding respondents’ likelihood to provide information about their income predict actual nonresponse rates. Results of multilevel modeling show that interviewer influence on nonresponse to the income and asset questions was significant at the five percent level. In addition, interviewer expectations were significantly correlated with “don’t know” responses and “refusals.” These results indicate that interviewer expectations matter in the context of income and asset questions and that survey practitioners should take this into account when designing interviewer training.},

This study examines interviewer effects on these indicators that were collected in two large-scale National Family Health Surveys ({NFHS}) in India (2005–2006 and 2015–2016). We use cross-classified random intercept multivariable multilevel logit models to examine interviewer effects. In both surveys, we find large interviewer effects on questions about the justification of a woman refusing to have sex with her husband (32–33\% in {NFHS}-3 and 45–46\% in {NFHS}-4) and the justification of wife beating (27–28\% in {NFHS}-3 and 33–34\% in {NFHS}-4). The interviewer effects were much larger in the 2015–2016 survey than in the 2005–2006 survey. Such large interviewer effects should be considered when interpreting trends and patterns on these topics, especially since the interviewer effects might have changed between survey rounds. Understanding interviewer effects is important given the wide use of these surveys in policy formulation and monitoring in India.},

	abstract = {Survey researchers have consistently found that interviewers make a small but systematic contribution to variability in response times. However, we know little about what the characteristics of interviewers are that lead to this effect. In this study, we address this gap in understanding by linking item-level response times from wave 3 of the {UK} Household Longitudinal Survey ({UKHLS}) to data from an independently conducted survey of interviewers. The linked data file contains over three million records and has a complex, hierarchical structure with response latencies nested within respondents and questions, which are themselves nested within interviewers and areas. We propose the use of a cross-classified mixed-effects location scale model to allow for the decomposition of the joint effects on response times of interviewers, areas, questions, and respondents. We evaluate how interviewer demographic characteristics, personality, and attitudes to surveys and to interviewing affect the length of response latencies and present a new method for producing interviewer-specific intra-class correlations of response times. Hence, the study makes both methodological and substantive contributions to the investigation of response times.},

Further, family ruptures during pregnancy depress birth outcomes and raise the risk of perinatal complications necessitating hospitalization. Our results suggest large welfare gains from preventing fetal stress from family ruptures and possibly from economically induced stressors such as unemployment. They further suggest that greater stress exposure among the poor may partially explain the intergenerational persistence of poverty. ({JEL} I12, J12, J13)},

Building on these technologies, this article presents a methodology of spatial sampling adopted for the respiratory health and demographic survey conducted in Delhi and its environs from January through April 2004. The overall goal of the survey was to select households that adequately represented exposure to ambient air pollution. The proposed methodology involved constructing a sampling frame of residential areas and the simulation of weighted random points within residential areas. The simulated locations were navigated with the aid of {GPS} to identify households at these locations and to acquire residents’ consent to participate in the survey; a total of 1,576 households at the 2,000 simulated locations were found suitable and participated in the survey. The average ambient air pollution at the sample sites was not significantly different from the average air pollution observed in the study area, which demonstrates the robustness of the proposed sampling method.},

            Introduction
            Between 2018 and 2022 the Liberian Government implemented the National Community Health Assistant ({NCHA}) program to improve provision of maternal and child health care to underserved rural areas of the country. Whereas the contributions of this and similar community health worker ({CHW}) based healthcare programs have been associated with improved process measures, the impact of a governmental {CHW} program at scale on child mortality has not been fully established.
          
          
            Methods/Design
            We will conduct a cluster sampled, community-based survey with landmark event calendars to retrospectively assess child births and deaths among all children born to women in the Grand Bassa District of Liberia. We will use a mixed effects discrete survival model, taking advantage of the staggered program implementation in Grand Bassa districts over a period of 4 years to compare rates of under-5 child mortality between the pre- and post-{NCHA} program implementation periods.
          
          
            Discussion
            This study will be the first to estimate the impact of the Liberian {NCHA} program on under-5 mortality.

	abstract = {The Demographic and Health Surveys ({DHS}) have been carried out in over 90 countries since 1984, as interviewer administered household surveys conducted initially by paper and pencil interviews ({PAPI}). Computer assisted personal interviews ({CAPI}) were introduced in the 2004 Peru {DHS}, and since then numerous countries have also switched. However, {DHS} randomized mode comparisons have been limited. The 2018 Sixth Turkey {DHS} was conducted using {CAPI} but allocated one household from 21 in each of 754 clusters to {PAPI}. This analysis examines a wide range of potential differences between modes: interviewer attitudes toward modes; response rates, underreporting and misreporting of persons or events, number of selections to “check all that applies” questions, respondents' attitudes towards modes reflected by responses to sensitive questions, satisficing behavior such as age heaping, straight-line response patterns, and use of don’t know options; and some operational aspects of modes such as retrospective monthly contraceptive prevalence rates, presence of others during interview, and interview length. Findings show that, despite strong interviewer {CAPI} preference, {CAPI} and {PAPI} were on average almost identical in terms of responses. {CAPI} took 11 min less (total duration of 33 min). Analysis of retrospective monthly contraception use indicated potential underreporting by {CAPI} for past use, an issue highlighted before in {DHS} literature. Overall, the switch to computer technology in {DHS} surveys does not appear to change estimates or levels of nonsampling errors, although some differences with respect to {PAPI} mode may need {DHS} designer attention.},

	abstract = {The key to understanding the experience of {AIDS} mortality lies in the stories that people tell each other about those they know who are suspected to have died from {AIDS}. We use a unique set of texts produced by rural Malawians reporting everyday conversations in their communities. These texts, drawn from the online archive of the Malawi Journals Project, consist of several thousand instances of ordinary people telling each other stories in the ordinary course of their lives. They are a form of insider ethnography, accounts of everyday life written by people immersed in the lives of their communities. Through analysis of these texts, we show that narratives of death are predicated upon the question ‘Who is to blame?’ We argue that a micropolitics of blame arises from practices of narrating death and shapes individual and collective responses to the epidemic. When we pay attention to the details of the production and exchange of these stories, we can see how the fact that narratives of death are predicated upon the question of blame both expresses and produces a desire for justice, both for the righting of wrongs through retributive punishment and for the restoration of harmonious social relations among the living. This desire for justice, we argue, is a central feature of the social impact of {AIDS}., La clé pour comprendre l’expérience de mortalité par le {SIDA} réside dans les récits que les personnes se racontent mutuellement à propos de ceux qui sont suspectés d’être morts du {SIDA}. Il utilise pour cela une collection unique de textes produits par des ruraux du Malawi relatant des conversations du quotidien au sein de leurs communautés. Ces textes, tirés des archives en ligne du Malawi Journals Project, consistent en plusieurs milliers de cas de personnes ordinaires se racontant des récits dans le cours ordinaire de leur existence. Ils sont une forme d’ethnographie de l’intérieur, des récits de la vie quotidienne rédigés par des personnes immergées dans la vie de leur communauté. À travers l’analyse de ces textes, l’auteur montre que les récits de mort reposent sur la question « À qui la faute ? ». Il soutient qu’une micropolitique du blâme résulte de pratiques de récit de mort et façonne les réactions individuelles et collectives à l’épidémie. L’étude des détails relatifs à la production et à l'échange de ces récits montre comment le fait que les récits de mort reposent sur la question du blâme exprime et produit un désir de justice, à la fois pour rectifier des tors par une punition rétributive et pour rétablir des relations sociales harmonieuses entre les vivants. Ce désir de justice est, selon l’auteur, un élément central de l’impact social du {SIDA}.},

	shorttitle = {Effects of a sister's death in childbirth on reproductive behaviors},
	abstract = {Rationale
Risk of maternal mortality increases rapidly during the intrapartum period making skilled care at delivery an effective intervention to reduce the risk of maternal death. Demand generation for skilled care typically focuses on institutional channels; however, much less attention has been paid to whether what women may learn through their social networks can potentially influence their choice of delivery care.
Objective
The objective of this study was to analyze whether a sister's death in childbirth has the potential to improve delivery care choices for women who experience this event.
Methods
This study uses retrospective reports of sister deaths - either in childbirth or from some other cause - reported in the sisterhood moratlity module from five waves of the Indonesia Demographic and Health Surveys ({IDHS}) spanning 1989 to 2012. A cross-sectional, difference-in-difference strategy compares delivery care behavior of women before and after losing a sister in childbirth to women before and after losing a sister of reproductive age from some other cause in an intent-to-treat framework.
Results
Women are less likely to give birth at home after losing a sister in childbirth relative to women who lose a sister from some other cause. Losing a sister in childbirth may trigger behaviors that help usher women of lower socioeconomic status into formal delivery care.
Conclusion
This study extends the literature on health behavior change through social networks to improve delivery care. Public health campaigns should consider social networks when designing messages around maternal mortality in order to help women at risk of maternal mortality make decisions that reduce their risk of and ultimately avoid maternal death.},

	abstract = {Objective To investigate the extent of geospatial clustering of reported deaths during the Ebola outbreak in Liberia and the covariates associated with the observed clustering.
Design Cross-sectional study.
Participants Male and female respondents from the 2019–2020 Liberia Demographic and Health Survey. The analysis covered 11 928 (women=7854 and men=4074) respondents for whom complete data were available.
Outcome measures The outcome variable was the death of a household member or relative during the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, coded 1 if the respondent reported death and 0 otherwise.
Methods We applied the Bayesian geoadditive semiparametric regression to examine the extent of geospatial clustering of deaths at the district-level and community-level development and socioeconomic factors associated with the observed clustering.
Results Almost a quarter (24.8\%) of all respondents reported the death of a household member or relative during the Ebola outbreak. The results show that deaths were clustered within districts in six (Grand Cape Mount, Bomi, Monsterrado, Margibi, Gbarpolu and Lofa) of the 15 counties in Liberia. Districts with high death clustering were all near or shared borders with Sierra Leone and Guinea. The community-level development indicators (global human footprint, gross cell production and population density) had a non-linear associative effect with the observed spatial clustering. Also, respondents’ characteristics (respondent’s age (non-linear effect), educational attainment and urban-rural place of residence) were associated with the observed clustering. The results show that death clustering during outbreaks was constrained to poor settings and impacts areas of moderate and high socioeconomic development.
Conclusion Reported deaths during the Ebola outbreak in Liberia were not randomly distributed at the district level but clustered. The findings highlight the need to identify at-risk populations during epidemics and respond with the needed interventions to save lives.},

	abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals call for a total reduction of preventable child mortality before 2030. Further, the goals state the desirability to have subnational mortality estimates. Estimates at this level are required for health interventions at the subnational level. In a low and middle income countries context, the data on mortality typically consist of household surveys, which are carried out with a stratified, cluster design, and census microsamples. Most household surveys collect full birth history ({FBH}) data on birth and death dates of a mother’s children, but censuses collect summary birth history ({SBH}) data which consist only of the number of children born and the number that died. In previous work, direct (survey-weighted) estimates with associated variances were derived from {FBH} data and smoothed in space and time. Unfortunately, the {FBH} data from household surveys are usually not sufficiently abundant to obtain yearly estimates at the Admin-2 level (at which interventions are often made). In this paper we describe four extensions to previous work: (i) combining {SBH} data with {FBH} data, (ii) modeling on a yearly scale, to combine data on a yearly scale with data at coarser time scales, (iii) adjusting direct estimates in Admin-2 areas where we do not observe any deaths due to small sample sizes, (iv) acknowledge differences in data sources by modeling potential bias arising from the various data sources. The methods are illustrated using household survey and census data from Kenya and Malawi, to produce mortality estimates from 1980 to the time of the most recent survey, and predictions to 2020.},

	abstract = {The household surveys conducted by the Demographic and Health Surveys ({DHS}) Program are a key source of data for estimating demographic and health indicators at a fine spatial scale in low- and middle-income countries. The surveys provide jittered coordinates for visited clusters, where coordinates are randomly displaced according to a known jittering distribution. We develop a geostatistical model that accounts for the positional uncertainty when analysing {DHS} surveys, and provide a fast implementation using Template Model Builder. The approach works for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian likelihoods. A simulation study with binomial data shows that the new approach performs equally or better than the common practice of not accounting for jittering, both in terms of more accurate parameter estimates and improved predictive measures. The improvement increases with increased amount of jittering. An analysis of contraceptive use in Kenya shows that the approach is fast and easy to use in practice.},

	abstract = {Earthquakes occur as a result of global plate motion. However, this simple picture is far from complete. Some plate boundaries glide past each other smoothly, while others are punctuated by catastrophic failures. Some earthquakes stop after only a few hundred metres while others continue rupturing for a thousand kilometres. Earthquakes are sometimes triggered by other large earthquakes thousands of kilometres away. We address these questions by dissecting the observable phenomena and separating out the quantifiable features for comparison across events. We begin with a discussion of stress in the crust followed by an overview of earthquake phenomenology, focusing on the parameters that are readily measured by current seismic techniques. We briefly discuss how these parameters are related to the amplitude and frequencies of the elastic waves measured by seismometers as well as direct geodetic measurements of the Earth's deformation. We then review the major processes thought to be active during the rupture and discuss their relation to the observable parameters. We then take a longer range view by discussing how earthquakes interact as a complex system. Finally, we combine subjects to approach the key issue of earthquake initiation. This concluding discussion will require using the processes introduced in the study of rupture as well as some novel mechanisms. As our observational database improves, our computational ability accelerates and our laboratories become more refined, the next few decades promise to bring more insights on earthquakes and perhaps some answers.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper seeks to provide graduate students, researchers, and government and independent agencies with an overview of disasters. Design/methodology/approach – Disasters have been the subject of research and a source of concern to academicians and government and independent agencies. In this paper disaster types are collected from several sources such as technical, general articles, internet web sites, and internal reports. Disaster types, definitions, hazards and mitigations are reviewed. Disasters are classified into natural disasters, man‐made disasters, and hybrid disasters. Man‐made disasters are classified into technological disasters, transportation accidents, public places failure, and production failure. Natural and/or man‐made disasters sometimes lead to subsequent disasters. Findings – Disasters are classified into three types: natural, man‐made, and hybrid disasters. It is believed that the three disaster types cover all disastrous events. Disasters have different characteristics and impacts; however, disasters have a common element, which is their severity. Natural disasters are those disasters that result from natural forces. Man‐made disasters are those disasters that result from human decisions. Hybrid disasters are those disasters that result from both natural and man‐made causes. Subsequent disasters are those disasters that result from natural and/or man‐made disasters. Epidemics could be a disaster or a subsequent disaster. Originality/value – This paper presents the types, definition, hazards, and mitigation of disasters. Disasters are arranged into disaster types, sub‐disasters, and disastrous events in the form of a disaster tree. An algorithm can be written utilizing this disaster tree. The algorithm can be used for training purposes to prevent or reduce disasters.},

The extent of family clustering is estimated before and after controlling for observed child and family demographic, reproductive, and socioeconomic characteristics and unobserved community characteristics. The study also investigates the extent to which the coefficient estimates and standard errors are altered with better controls for unobserved heterogeneity at the family level and at the community level. These controls are achieved through the use of a multilevel nested frailty model for survival data. The variance of family frailty is overstated by a factor of four when unobserved community effects are omitted. The family-level variance is not statistically significant in the multilevel model, although it is highly significant in the model that includes only the family frailty effect. Furthermore, ignoring the full design effects results in systematic bias in parameter estimates and standard errors.},

Contemporary results, methodological and theoretical shortfalls, recent developments, and opportunities for future research are all discussed in this review. Four methodological approaches are distinguished: those based on sibling deaths, mother heterogeneity, thresholds, and excess deaths in populations. It has become clear from research to date that the death of an older child harms the survival chances of younger children in that family, and that fertility behaviour, earlier stillbirths, remarriages, and socio-economic status all explain mortality clustering to some extent.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: We aim to examine the phenomenon of infant and child death clustering while considering the unobserved heterogeneity (frailty) at the family level.
{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: We analysed Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2017-2018 data, including the birth history information for 47 828 children born to 18 134 women. We used Gompertz shared frailty model to control the correlation between event times at the mother level and capture the unobserved risks in infant and child deaths.
{OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: We estimated two sets of survival regression models where the failure event is the survival status of the index child during the infancy period, that is, from birth to 11 months, and childhood period, that is, between 12 and 59 months, respectively. All children who died during infancy and childhood were coded as 'yes'; otherwise, they were coded as 'no'.
{RESULTS}: About 2\% of mothers experienced two or more infant deaths, and cumulatively these mothers account for 20\% of all infant deaths in the sample. Children whose previous sibling was not alive at the time of their conception had 1.86 times (95\% {CI} 1.59 to 2.17) more risk of dying as an infant. However, we did not find a statistically significant effect of death scarring on the risk of child mortality among siblings. Statistically significant frailty effect with a variance of 0.33 (95\% {CI} {CI} 0.17 to 0.65) and 0.54 (95\% {CI} 0.14 to 2.03)] in infancy and childhood, respectively, indicates the clustering of survival risks within families due to unobserved family-level characteristics shared by the siblings.
{CONCLUSION}: This study suggests that preceding birth interval, mother's age at first birth and mother's education are the most critical factors which can help in reducing scaring effect on infant mortality. Additionally, women from poor socioeconomic strata should be focused on as still an infant, and child mortality is concentrated among poor households.},

	shorttitle = {Effect of maternal age on facility-based delivery},
	abstract = {Objectives Increasing access to skilled birth attendance, usually via childbirth in health facilities, is a key intervention to reduce maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Yet, in some countries of sub-Saharan Africa, the uptake is {\textless}50\%. Age and parity are determinants of facility-based delivery, but are strongly correlated in high fertility settings. This analysis assessed the independent effect of age on facility-based delivery by restricting to first-order births. It was hypothesised that older first-time mothers in this setting might have lower uptake of facility-based deliveries than women in the most common age groups for first birth.
Setting The most recent Demographic and Health Surveys from 34 sub-Saharan African countries were used to assess women’s delivery locations.
Participants 72 772 women having their first birth in the 5 years preceding the surveys were included in the analysis.
Primary and secondary outcome measures Proportions and 95\% {CIs} of facility-based deliveries were estimated overall and by country. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate the odds of facility-based delivery for different maternal age groups (15–19, 20–24 and ≥25 years) for a pooled sample of all countries.
Results 59.9\% of women had a facility-based delivery for their first birth (95\% {CI} 58.6 to 61.2), ranging from 19.4\% in Chad to 96.6\% in Rwanda. Compared with women aged 15–19 years, the adjusted odds of having a facility-based delivery for those aged 20–24 was 1.4 (95\% {CI} 1.3 to 1.5, p{\textless}0.001) and for those aged ≥25, 1.9 (95\% {CI} 1.6 to 2.2, p{\textless}0.001).
Conclusions Older age at first birth was independently associated with significantly higher odds of facility-based delivery. This went against the hypothesis. Further mixed-method research is needed to explore how increased age improves uptake of facility-based delivery. Promoting facility-based delivery, while ensuring quality of care, should be prioritised to improve birth outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa.},

	abstract = {Introduction Along with the developing world, Bangladesh has made a tremendous improvement in declining total fertility rate, however, this declining trend is not uniform to all the socio-demographic stratum. Incongruities exist between the numbers of children that women bearing and what they actually desired which refers to unmet fertility desire. This study aims to elicit women’s perception of ideal number of children and predictors of unmet fertility desire in Bangladesh. Method This study analyzed nationally representative cross-sectional Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2014 data. A two-stage stratified random sampling technique was used while a total of 17,863 ever-married women were interviewed between June and November 2014. A total of 10,912 eligible women were included in the analysis. Poisson regression analysis and logistic regression models were used to measure women’s perception of the ideal number of children and to determine the influencing factors of unmet fertility desires. Result The mean value of the perceived ideal number of children was 2.22 ({SD} ± 0.73) and the majority of women (71.2\%) expect to have two children in their lifetime. Approximately 46\% of mothers reported bearing more children than they desired. The perceived ideal number of children was significantly higher among women who were living in rural areas, from Sylhet division, Muslim, unemployed, and experienced child death and those who justified beating. Findings revealed that several factors such as place of residence, geographic location, religion, wealth index, maternal age and education, partners’ education, experiencing child death, and other empowerment-related indicators were significantly associated with unmet fertility desires. Conclusion Perceived ideal number of children differs among women’s socioeconomic and demographic strata. Unmet fertility desire was also found which indicates that reproductive knowledge and health care services are still necessary for some socio-demographically disadvantaged/vulnerable people and this group should be regularly monitored to control population growth.},

	abstract = {Background A woman’s ability to achieve her preferred family size is critical in addressing issues of high fertility in sub-Saharan Africa. The socio-cultural context in sub-Saharan Africa presents some difficulty for the attainment of preferred fertility for many women. Few studies in sub-Saharan Africa have examined the extent to which women are unable to achieve their preferred family sizes. This study, therefore, examines the factors that are associated with the non-attainment of women’s preferred fertility by the end of their reproductive years. Data and methods The study analyzed pooled cross-sectional data with a sub-sample of 1,888 currently married women aged 45–49 years from five rounds of the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, 1993 to 2014. Test of associations and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used to examine the predictors of underachieved and overachieved fertility relative to achieved fertility. Results The results indicate that 44 per cent of the women recorded overachieved fertility while about 36 per cent underachieved their fertility. Partner wants more, experiencing child loss and married more than once were significantly associated with overachieved fertility. Nonetheless, increased years of a woman’s education and delaying her at first birth were negatively associated with overachieved fertility. On the other hand, underachieved fertility was significantly associated with having a partner with fewer fertility preference, being of the Islamic faith and ever use of modern contraception. Conclusion Partner’s fertility preference, child loss experience, marrying more than once and ever use of modern contraception were important predictors of a woman’s inability to achieve her fertility preference. Policies to regulate men’s fertility behaviour, delaying age at first birth, use of modern contraception, encouraging longer years of education, and reducing infant and child mortality are important strategies to achieve fertility preference in Ghana.},

The study used the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. We applied the conventional neo-classical consumer-theoretic approach to model the demand of children. The study aimed to estimate the demographic effects on fertility among women of reproductive age 15-49 in Ghana using the negative binomial regression. The results indicated that the age of women at first births, mother’s years of education, number of unions, wealth level, women occupations, Partners occupation, contraceptive use and intention, marital status, are significant and negatively associated with the number of children ever born. However, current age of the woman, fertility preference, decision maker on contraceptive use, child sex, number of living children and experienced of the death of a son and/or daughter resulting from replacement effect and hoarding effects and residing in rural areas have positively and significantly influence fertility in Ghana. We recorded variations in the effects of some variables in total, urban and rural samples. We conclude that reduction in child mortality, increasing women access of formal education, increasing women power in decision making on contraceptive use, increasing access to and use of contraceptives as well as reducing income disparity between urban and rural population by providing employment opportunities in rural areas are keys policy issues that could help achieve fertility reduction in Ghana.},

	abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa has entered the early stage of the demographic transition with differences in and between countries. The relation between fertility preference and actual fertility is at the core of the demographic changes during the demographic transition in sub-Saharan Africa. At the current pace of the demographic transition, overachieved fertility (actual fertility being higher than fertility preference) is more prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa although some women do achieve their fertility preference. Our aim is to assess the trends and identify factors that consistently influence women with completed fertility to achieve their fertility desires in Ghana over a 10-year period. We used secondary data from the 2003, 2008 and 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys for the analysis. The sample size was restricted to currently married/living in union women aged 45–49 years. The results indicate that underachieved fertility has increased from 25.1\% in 2003 to 35.8\% in 2014. Similarly, achieved fertility has also increased from 23.8\% in 2003 to 26.0\% in 2014. On the contrary, overachieved fertility has decreased from 51.1\% in 2003 to 38.2\% in 2014. The most persistent determinants of achieved fertility relative to overachieved fertility in Ghana during the last three rounds of the Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys are child survival status, ethnicity and couple’s fertility preference. The study provides support for programmatic interventions targeting improving child survival and regulating men’s fertility preference.},

	abstract = {A common explanation for the high fertility prevailing in sub-Saharan Africa ({SSA}) is a widespread desire for large families. This situation poses a challenge to population policy-makers in the continent. If the desired family size is high, then presumably family planning programs can only have a limited effect on fertility because these programs aim to assist women in achieving their reproductive goals. But this conclusion is based on the assumption that family planning programs do not affect the desired family size, which is questionable and is investigated here. This study examines the determinants of trends wanted and unwanted fertility in {SSA} using fixed-effects regressions of country-level data. The dependent variables include the total fertility rate, and its wanted and unwanted components. Explanatory variables include a family planning program score and four socioeconomic variables (women’s educational attainment, child mortality, {GNI} per capita, and percent urban). Data come from 103 {DHS} surveys in 25 countries in {SSA} with at least two {DHS} surveys between 1989 and 2019. Women’s education and family planning programs are found to be the dominant determinants of fertility decline and their effects operate by reducing both wanted and unwanted fertility. The effects of education are not surprising but the finding that family planning programs can reduce wanted fertility implies that their impact can be larger than conventional wisdom suggests. Indeed, in a few poor countries, the implementation of high-quality programs has been associated with substantial declines in wanted fertility (e.g., Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda). The mechanism through which this effect operates is unclear but likely involves media programs that diffuse knowledge about the benefits of smaller families.},

Background Premarital sex and fertility rates are high in many sub-Saharan African countries, yet we know little about how premarital childbirth, or even premarital conception, corresponds with women's subsequent marital outcomes. For instance, it is unknown whether premarital fertility is associated with forming unions that are less stable, polygynous, or more violent. Method We analyze Demographic and Health Survey data for 25 sub-Saharan African countries to describe women's marital experiences following a premarital pregnancy or premarital birth (relative to marital pregnancy and birth). We estimate country-specific, two-stage Heckman probit models to understand whether, conditional on having married, premarital pregnancy or premarital birth is associated with union instability, and among women currently married, polygyny and intimate partner violence. Results In most countries, unions following a premarital pregnancy or premarital birth were less stable relative to unions in which pregnancy occurred only after marriage. Premarital births were also associated with a higher likelihood of entering a polygynous union, especially in West and Central African countries, as well as a greater likelihood of being in a physically violent union, particularly in East and Southern African countries. Conclusion The associations between premarital fertility and women's subsequent marital experiences raise questions about the broader health and life course implications for the women and children involved.},

This study endeavoured to explore the effect of the quality of prenatal care and its individual components on neonatal, infant and under-five mortality. The empirical analysis uses data from the three most recent waves of the nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey for Zimbabwe conducted in 1999, 2005/06 and 2010/11. The results indicate that a one-unit increase in the quality of prenatal care lowers the prospect of neonatal, infant and under-five mortality by approximately 42.33, 30.86 and 28.65\%, respectively. These findings remained roughly the same even after adjusting for potential mediating factors. Examining the effect of individual prenatal care components on child mortality revealed that women who receive information on possible complications arising during pregnancy are less liable to experience a neonatal death. Similarly, women who had blood pressure checks and tetanus immunizations were less likely to experience an infant or under-five death. We did not find any statistically meaningful impact on child mortality outcomes of blood and urine sample checks, iron tablet consumption, and the receipt of malarial tablets. Overall, our results suggest the need for public health policymakers to focus on ensuring high-quality prenatal care to enhance the survival prospects of Zimbabwe’s infants.},

This study describes the context surrounding children’s deaths from the time the illness was first noticed, through the care-seeking patterns leading up to the child’s death, and identifies factors associated with care-seeking for these children in rural Rwanda. Methods Secondary analysis of a verbal and social autopsy study of caregivers who reported the death of a child between March 2013 to February 2014 that occurred after discharge from the child’s birth facility in southern Kayonza and Kirehe districts in Rwanda. Bivariate analyses using Fisher’s exact tests were conducted to identify child, caregiver, and household factors associated with care-seeking from the formal health system (i.e., community health worker or health facility). Factors significant at α = 0.10 significance level were considered for backwards stepwise multivariate logistic regression, stopping when remaining factors were significantly associated with care-seeking at α = 0.05 significance level. Results Among the 516 eligible deaths among children under-five, 22.7\% (n = 117) did not seek care from the health system. For those who did, the most common first point of contact was community health workers (45.8\%). In multivariate logistic regression, higher maternal education ({OR} = 3.36, 95\% {CI}: 1.89, 5.98), having diarrhea ({OR} = 4.21, 95\%{CI}: 1.95, 9.07) or fever ({OR} = 2.03, 95\%{CI}: 1.11, 3.72), full household insurance coverage (3.48, 95\%{CI}: 1.79, 6.76), and longer duration of illness ({OR} = 22.19, 95\%{CI}: 8.88, 55.48) were significantly associated with formal care-seeking. Conclusion Interventions such as community health workers and insurance promote access to care, however a gap remains as many children had no contact with the health system prior to death and those who sought formal care still died. Further efforts are needed to respond to urgent cases in communities and further understand remaining barriers to accessing appropriate, quality care.},

	abstract = {Background
Ensuring quality of care during pregnancy and childbirth is crucial to improving health outcomes and reducing preventable mortality and morbidity among women and their newborns. In this pursuit, {WHO} developed a framework and standards, defining 31 quality statements and 352 quality measures to assess and improve quality of maternal and newborn care in health-care facilities. We aimed to assess the capacity of globally used, large-scale facility assessment tools to measure quality of maternal and newborn care as per the {WHO} framework.
Methods
We identified assessment tools through a purposive sample that met the following inclusion criteria: multicountry, facility-level, major focus on maternal and newborn health, data on input and process indicators, used between 2007 and 2017, and currently in use. We matched questions in the tools with 274 quality measures associated with inputs and processes within the {WHO} standards. We excluded quality measures relating to outcomes because these are not routinely measured by many assessment tools. We used descriptive statistics to calculate how many quality measures could be assessed using each of the tools under review. Each tool was assigned a 1 for fulfilling a quality measure based on the presence of any or all components as indicated in the standards.
Findings
Five surveys met our inclusion criteria: the Service Provision Assessment ({SPA}), developed for the Demographic and Health Surveys programme; the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment, developed by {WHO}; the Needs Assessment of Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care developed by the Averting Maternal Death and Disability programme at Columbia University; and the World Bank's Service Delivery Indicator ({SDI}) and Impact Evaluation Toolkit for Results Based Financing in Health. The proportion of quality measures covered ranged from 62\% for the {SPA} to 12\% for the {SDI}. Although the broadest tool addressed parts of each of the 31 quality statements, 68 (25\%) of 274 input and process quality measures were not measured at all. Measures of health information systems and patient experience of care were least likely to be included.
Interpretation
Existing facility assessment tools provide a valuable way to assess quality of maternal and newborn care as one element within the national measurement toolkit. Guidance is clearly needed on priority measures and for better harmonisation across tools to reduce measurement burden and increase data use for quality improvement. Targeted development of measurement modules to address important gaps is a key priority for research.

	abstract = {Extreme weather events pose significant threats to urban health in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where there are systemic health challenges. This paper investigates health system vulnerabilities associated with flooding and extreme heat, along with strategies for resilience building by service providers and community members, in Accra and Tamale, Ghana. We employed field observations, rainfall records, temperature measurements, and semi-structured interviews in health facilities within selected areas of both cities. Results indicate that poor building conditions, unstable power supply, poor sanitation and hygiene, and the built environment reduce access to healthcare for residents of poor urban areas. Health facilities are sited in low-lying areas with poor drainage systems and can be 6 °C warmer at night than reported by official records from nearby weather stations. This is due to a combination of greater thermal inertia of the buildings and the urban heat island effect. Flooding and extreme heat interact with socioeconomic conditions to impact physical infrastructure and disrupt community health as well as health facility operations. Community members and health facilities make infrastructural and operational adjustments to reduce extreme weather stress and improve healthcare provision to clients. These measures include: mobilisation of residents to clear rubbish and unclog drains; elevating equipment to protect it from floods; improving ventilation during extreme heat; and using alternative power sources for emergency surgery and storage during outages. Stakeholders recommend additional actions to manage flood and heat impacts on health in their cities, such as, improving the capacity of drainage systems to carry floodwaters, and routine temperature monitoring to better manage heat in health facilities. Finally, more timely and targeted information systems and emergency response plans are required to ensure preparedness for extreme weather events in urban areas.},

	abstract = {Objective
To systematically review the public health literature to assess trends in the use of Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}) data for research from 1984 to 2010 and to describe the relationship between data availability and data utilization.

Methods
The {MEASURE} {DHS} web site was searched for information on all population-based surveys completed under the {DHS} project between 1984 and 2010. The information collected included the country, type of survey, survey design, fieldwork period and certain special features, such as inclusion of biomarkers. A search of {PubMed} was also conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles published during 2010 that analysed {DHS} data and included an English-language abstract. Trends in data availability and in the use of {DHS} data for research were assessed through descriptive, graphical and bivariate linear regression analyses.

Findings
In total, 236 household surveys under the {DHS} project were completed across 84 countries during 2010. The number of surveys per year has remained constant, although the scope of the survey questions has expanded. The inclusion criteria were met by 1117 peer-reviewed publications. The number of publications has increased progressively over the last quarter century, with an average annual increment of 4.3 (95\% confidence interval, {CI}: 3.2–5.3) publications. Trends in the number of peer-reviewed publications based on the use of {DHS} data were highly correlated with trends in funding for health by the Government of the United States of America and globally.

Conclusion
Published peer-reviewed articles analysing {DHS} data, which have increased progressively in number over the last quarter century, have made a substantial contribution to the public health evidence base in developing countries.},

This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (“{ADEMP}”); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations. With a view to describing recent practice, we review 100 articles taken from Volume 34 of Statistics in Medicine, which included at least one simulation study and identify areas for improvement.},

	abstract = {Introduction Health Management Information Systems ({HMIS}) are vital to ensure accountability and for making decisions including for tracking the Sustainable Development Goals. The Ethiopia Health Sector Transformation Plan {II} includes preventing data falsification as a major strategic initiative and our study aimed to explore the reasons why healthcare providers intentionally falsify maternal and newborn health ({MNH}) data in two regions of Ethiopia.
Methods We conducted a qualitative study in two hospitals, four health centres and their associated health posts in Oromia and Amhara regions. We conducted 45 in-depth interviews with health facility managers, quality improvement ({QI}) focal persons, health information technicians, {MNH} care providers, Health Extension Workers and {QI} mentors. Data were collected in local languages and transcribed in English. During analysis we repeatedly read the transcripts, coded them inductively using {NVivo} V.12, and categorised the codes into themes.
Results Participants were hesitant to report personal data falsification but many reported that falsification is common and that they had experienced it in other facilities or had been told about it by other health workers. Falsification was mostly inflating the number of services provided (such as deliveries). Decreasing the number of deaths or reclassifying neonatal death into stillbirths was also reported. An overarching theme was that the health system focuses on, and rewards, the number of services provided over any other metric. This focus led to both system and individual level incentives for falsification and disincentives for accurate reporting.
Conclusion Our finding suggests that to reduce facility level data falsification policy makers might consider disentangling reward and punishments from the performance reports based on the routine {HMIS} data. Further studies examining the high-level drivers of falsification at regional, national and global levels and effective interventions to address the drivers of data falsification are needed.},

	abstract = {Introduction Prompt access to emergency obstetrical care ({EmOC}) reduces the risk of maternal mortality. We assessed institutional maternal mortality by distance and travel time for pregnant women with obstetrical emergencies in Lagos State, Nigeria.
Methods We conducted a facility-based retrospective cohort study across 24 public hospitals in Lagos. Reviewing case notes of the pregnant women presenting between 1 November 2018 and 30 October 2019, we extracted socio-demographic, travel and obstetrical data. The extracted travel data were exported to Google Maps, where driving distance and travel time data were extracted. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine the relative influence of distance and travel time on maternal death.
Findings Of 4181 pregnant women with obstetrical emergencies, 182 (4.4\%) resulted in maternal deaths. Among those who died, 60.3\% travelled ≤10 km directly from home, and 61.9\% arrived at the hospital ≤30 mins. The median distance and travel time to {EmOC} was 7.6 km ({IQR} 3.4–18.0) and 26 mins ({IQR} 12–50). For all women, travelling 10–15 km (2.53, 95\% {CI} 1.27 to 5.03) was significantly associated with maternal death. Stratified by referral, odds remained statistically significant for those travelling 10–15 km in the non-referred group (2.48, 95\% {CI} 1.18 to 5.23) and for travel ≥120 min (7.05, 95\% {CI} 1.10 to 45.32). For those referred, odds became statistically significant at 25–35 km (21.40, 95\% {CI} 1.24 to 36.72) and for journeys requiring travel time from as little as 10–29 min (184.23, 95\% {CI} 5.14 to 608.51). Odds were also significantly higher for women travelling to hospitals in suburban (3.60, 95\% {CI} 1.59 to 8.18) or rural (2.51, 95\% {CI} 1.01 to 6.29) areas.
Conclusion Our evidence shows that distance and travel time influence maternal mortality differently for referred women and those who are not. Larger scale research that uses closer-to-reality travel time and distance estimates as we have done, rethinking of global guidelines, and bold actions addressing access gaps, including within the suburbs, will be critical in reducing maternal mortality by 2030.},

	abstract = {Introduction Geographic access to family planning ({FP}) services has been characterised through a variety of proximity metrics. However, there is little evidence on the validity of women’s self-reported compared with modelled travel time to an {FP} outlet, or between different distance measures.
Methods We used data from four urban sites in Kenya. A longitudinal {FP} outlet census was directly linked with data from cross-sectional {FP} user surveys. We combined characteristics of outlet visited to obtain {FP}, transport mode, self-reported travel time and location of households and outlets with data on road networks, elevation, land use and travel barriers within a cost-distance algorithm to compute modelled travel time, route and Euclidean distance between households and outlets. We compared modelled and self-reported travel times, Euclidean and route distances and the use of visited versus nearest facility.
Results 931 contraceptive users were directly linked to their {FP} source. Self-reported travel times were consistently and significantly higher than modelled times, with greater differences for those using vehicles rather than walking. Modelled and Euclidean distances were similar in the four geographies. 20\% of women used their nearest {FP} outlet while 52\% went to their nearest outlet when conditional on it offering their most recently used {FP} method.
Conclusion In urban areas with high facility density and good road connectivity, over half of {FP} users visited their nearest outlet with their chosen method available. In these settings, Euclidean distances were sufficient to characterise geographic proximity; however, reported and modelled travel times differed across all sites.},

Among the methods that are under-used, mapping has always represented a powerful way to ‘tell the story’ of a health problem in an easily understood way. In addition to this, the advanced analytical methods and models now being embedded into Geographic Information Systems allow a more in-depth analysis of the causes behind adverse maternal and newborn health ({MNH}) outcomes.

	abstract = {Background : Major improvements are required in the coverage and quality of essential childhood interventions to achieve Millennium Development Goal Four ({MDG} 4). Long distance to health facilities is one of the known barriers to access. We investigated the effect of networked and Euclidean distances from home to formal health facilities on childhood mortality in rural Tanzania between 2005 and 2007. Methods : A secondary analysis of data from a cohort of 28,823 children younger than age 5 between 2005 and 2007 from Ifakara Health and Demographic Surveillance System was carried out. Both Euclidean and networked distances from the household to the nearest health facility were calculated using geographical information system methods. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate the effect of distance from home to the nearest health facility on child mortality. Results : Children who lived in homes with networked distance {\textgreater}5 km experienced approximately 17\% increased mortality risk ({HR}=1.17; 95\% {CI} 1.02–1.38) compared to those who lived {\textless}5 km networked distance to the nearest health facility. Death of a mother ({HR}=5.87; 95\% {CI} 4.11–8.40), death of preceding sibling ({HR}=1.9; 95\% {CI} 1.37–2.65), and twin birth ({HR}=2.9; 95\% {CI} 2.27–3.74) were the strongest independent predictors of child mortality. Conclusions : Physical access to health facilities is a determinant of child mortality in rural Tanzania. Innovations to improve access to health facilities coupled with birth spacing and care at birth are needed to reduce child deaths in rural Tanzania.},

	abstract = {Background
Poor maternal health service utilization is one of the contributing factors to a high level of maternal and newborn mortality in Ethiopia. The factors associated with utilization of services are believed to differ from one context to another. We assessed the factors associated with skilled delivery service utilization in rural northern Ethiopia.

Subjects and methods
A community-based survey was conducted among mothers who gave birth in the 12 months preceding the study period, from January to February 2015, in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. Multistage sampling technique was used to select mothers from the identified clusters. Households within a 10 km radius of the health facility were taken as a cluster for a community survey. Data were collected using face-to-face interview at the household level. We compared the mothers who reported giving birth to the index child in a health facility and those who reported delivering at home, in order to identify the predictors of skilled delivery utilization. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine the predictors of skilled delivery service utilization. The results are presented with odds ratio ({OR}) and 95\% confidence interval ({CI}).

Results
A total of 1,796 mothers participated in the study, with a 100\% response rate. Distance to health facilities (adjusted odds ratio [{AOR}] =0.53 [95\% {CI}: 0.39, 0.71]), perception of mothers to the availability of adequate equipment in the delivery service in their catchment area ({AOR} =1.5 [95\% {CI}: 1.11, 2.13]), experiencing any complication during childbirth, using antenatal care, lower birth order and having an educated partner were the significant predictors of skilled delivery service utilization.

Conclusion
Implementing community-based intervention programs that will address the physical accessibility of delivery services, such as the ambulance service, road issues and waiting rooms, and improving quality maternity service will likely reduce the current problem.},

	abstract = {Health policy-makers in developing countries are often disturbed and to a degree surprised by the phenomenon of the ill travelling past a free or subsidized local public clinic (or other public facility) to get to an alternative source of care at which they often pay a considerable amount for health care. That a person bypasses a facility is almost certainly indicative either of significant problems with the quality of care at the bypassed facility or of significantly better care at the alternative source of care chosen. When it is a poor person choosing to bypass a free public facility and pay for care further away, such action is especially bothersome to public policy-makers.This paper uses a unique data set, with a health facility survey in which all health facilities are identified, surveyed, and located geographically; and a household survey in which a sample of households from the same health district is also both surveyed and located geographically. The data are analyzed to examine patterns of health care choice related to the characteristics and locations of both the facilities and actual and potential clients. Rather than using the distance travelled or some other general choice of type of care variable as the dependent variable, we are able actually to analyze which specific facilities are bypassed and which chosen. The findings are instructive. That bypassing behaviour is not very different across income groups is certainly noteworthy, as is the fact that the more severely ill tend to bypass and to travel further for care than do the less severely ill. In multivariate analysis almost all characteristics of both providers and facilities are found to have the a priori expected relationships to facility choice. Prices tend to deter use, and improved quality of services to increase the likelihood of a facility being chosen. The answer to the bypassing dilemma seems to be for providers to provide as good quality care relative to the money charged (if any), as other, often further away, providers.},

	abstract = {Introduction There is growing recognition in the health community that the legal environment—including laws, policies, and related procedures—impacts vulnerability to {HIV} and access to {HIV}-related services both positively and negatively. Assessing changes in the legal environment and how these affect {HIV}-related outcomes, however, is challenging, and understanding of appropriate methodologies nascent. Methods We conducted an evaluation of a {UNDP} project designed to strengthen legal environments to support the human rights of key populations, in particular {LGBT} populations, women and girls, affected by {HIV} in sub-Saharan Africa. We analyzed data on activities designed to improve legal environments through a systematic document review and 53 qualitative interviews. Results The project made substantial strides towards legal change in many places, and examples provide broader lessons for work in this area. Two core pillars appear fundamental: a government-led participatory assessment of the legal environment, and building the capacity of those impacted by and engaged in this work. Systematic attention to human rights is vital: it can help open new spaces for dialogue among diverse stakeholders, foster new collaborations, and ensure local ownership, nuanced understanding of the political landscape, attention to marginalized populations, and accountability for (in)action. Entry points for effecting legal change go beyond “{HIV} laws” to also include other laws, national policies and strategies. Conclusion Conducting legal environment assessments, multi-stakeholder dialogues, action planning and related activities, alongside capacity building, can contribute to changes in knowledge and attitudes directly relevant to reforming laws that are found to be harmful. Shorter-term goals along the causal pathway to legal change (e.g. changes in policy) can constitute interim markers of success, and recognition of these can maintain momentum. Increasing understanding of progress towards changes in the legal environment that can positively affect {HIV}-related outcomes is important in working to improve the health and lives of people living with {HIV}.},

	abstract = {Maps of infectious disease—charting spatial variations in the force of infection, degree of endemicity and the burden on human health—provide an essential evidence base to support planning towards global health targets. Contemporary disease mapping efforts have embraced statistical modelling approaches to properly acknowledge uncertainties in both the available measurements and their spatial interpolation. The most common such approach is Gaussian process regression, a mathematical framework composed of two components: a mean function harnessing the predictive power of multiple independent variables, and a covariance function yielding spatio-temporal shrinkage against residual variation from the mean. Though many techniques have been developed to improve the flexibility and fitting of the covariance function, models for the mean function have typically been restricted to simple linear terms. For infectious diseases, known to be driven by complex interactions between environmental and socio-economic factors, improved modelling of the mean function can greatly boost predictive power. Here, we present an ensemble approach based on stacked generalization that allows for multiple nonlinear algorithmic mean functions to be jointly embedded within the Gaussian process framework. We apply this method to mapping Plasmodium falciparum prevalence data in sub-Saharan Africa and show that the generalized ensemble approach markedly outperforms any individual method.},

Among females, the figure is two-fifths. The major causes of death responsible for the below-fifty trends are unintentional injuries, including drug overdose—a fact that constitutes the most striking finding from this study; noncommunicable diseases; perinatal conditions, such as pregnancy complications and birth trauma; and homicide.

	abstract = {Purpose
Reliable data on sexual behavior are needed to identify adolescents at risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus or other sexually transmitted diseases, as well as unintended pregnancies. This study aimed to investigate whether schooling status and literacy and numeracy skills affect adolescents' reports of premarital sex, collected using audio computer-assisted self-interviews.
Methods
We analyzed data on 2,320 participants in the first three rounds of the Malawi Schooling and Adolescent Study to estimate the level of inconsistency in reporting premarital sex among rural Malawian adolescents. We used multivariate logistic regressions to examine the relationships between school status and academic skills and premarital sexual behavior reports.
Results
Males were more likely than females to report premarital sex at baseline, whereas females were more likely than males to report sex inconsistently within and across rounds. School-going females and males were more likely to report never having had sex at baseline and to retract reports of ever having sex across rounds than were their peers who had recently left school. School-going females were also more likely to report sex inconsistently at baseline. Literate and numerate respondents were less likely to report sex inconsistently at baseline; however, they were more likely to retract sex reports across rounds.
Conclusions
The level of inconsistency both within a survey round and across rounds reflects the difficulties in collecting reliable sexual behavior data from young people in settings such as rural Malawi, where education levels are low and sex among school-going females is not socially accepted.},

	abstract = {Context: Adolescents' sexual behavior is an important issue in developing countries and a focus of programmatic efforts for reducing pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease. Yet the accuracy of young people's reports of their sexual activity has rarely been carefully examined. Methods: Data from a three-round longitudinal study of 698 young adolescents in Jamaica were used to examine consistency in the reporting of first sexual intercourse. Adolescents were asked to respond to multiple questions about their first intercourse within each round of the survey, and the items were repeated in subsequent rounds. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the factors independently influencing the likelihood that adolescents would report their sexual experience inconsistently. Results: The vast majority of respondents (95-100\%) reported their sexual experience status consistently within a given survey round. However, when agreement of responses between rounds was examined, 37\% of respondents-12\% of girls and 65\% of boys-responded inconsistently. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that boys were nearly 14 times as likely as girls to report their sexual experience inconsistently. Conclusions: Pervasive inconsistency in the reporting of sexual activity, especially among boys, highlights the limitations of relying on self-reported data to identify sexually active adolescents and to quantify that activity. Using such data to evaluate the impact of interventions designed to delay first intercourse may also be problematic.},

Despite increases in free, aid-financed healthcare, private Haitian healthcare facilities have remained at a constant number.

However, they also identified negative impacts of international aid, including episodes of poor quality care, internal brain drain, competition across facilities, decrease in patient flow to local facilities, and emigration of Haitian doctors to abroad. As Haiti continues to recover, it is imperative for aid institutions and local healthcare facilities to develop a more collaborative relationship to transition acute relief to sustainable capacity building.

The ability to reliably communicate information about specific health facilities can support an array of health system functions, such as routine reporting and emergency response operations. {MHFLs} support the alignment of donor-supported health information systems with county-owned systems. Recent World Health Organization draft guidance promotes the utility of {MHFLs} and outlines a process for list development and governance. Although the potential benefits of {MHFLs} are numerous and may seem obvious, there are few documented cases of {MHFL} construction and use. The international response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake provides an example of how governments, nongovernmental organizations, and others can collaborate within a framework of standards to build a more complete and accurate list of health facilities. Prior to the earthquake, the Haitian Ministry of Health (Ministère de la Santé Publique et de la Population [{MSPP}]) maintained a list of public-sector health facilities but lacked information on privately managed facilities. Following the earthquake, the {MSPP} worked with a multinational group to expand the completeness and accuracy of the list of health facilities, including information on post-quake operational status. This list later proved useful in the response to the cholera epidemic and is now incorporated into the {MSPP}'s routine health information system. Haiti's experience demonstrates the utility of {MHFL} formation and use in crisis as well as in the routine function of the health information system.},

Data were extracted from 34 nationally representative surveys conducted in the region between 2006 and 2014. The study sample comprised unmarried women (n=167,932) and men (n=76,900) aged 15–24 years. Descriptive techniques and Cox proportional regression models were used to estimate the timing of sexual debut, and Kaplan–Meier hazard curves were used to describe the patterns of sexual debut in each country by sex. For the countries studied, sexual debut for both women and men occurred between the ages of 15 and 18 years, with median ages of 16 for women and 17 for men. Overall, education and household wealth provided significant protection against early sexual debut among women, but the reverse was found among men for wealth. Women in rural areas, in female-headed households and in Central, South and West Africa reported higher hazards of early commencement of sexual activity than their counterparts in urban, male-headed households and East Africa. However, the impact of these variables on male sexual debut did not follow a consistent pattern. Varied timing, as well as country-specific risk factors associated with sexual debut for young women and men across sub-Saharan Africa, were identified. Sexual health programmes and interventions for young people may require different approaches for young women and men.},

This report systematically reviewed the use of social desirability scales in studies addressing social desirability in clinical psychology. Method A systematic review (January 2010–March 2015) was conducted, including 35 studies meeting the inclusion criteria of being published in peer-reviewed journals and describing quantitative findings about an association of social desirability with clinical psychology variables using a cross-sectional or longitudinal design. Results Social desirability was associated with self-reports of various clinical-psychological dimensions. Most of the included studies treated social desirability as a 1-dimensional variable and only 10 of 35 disentangled the impression management and self-deception components. Although theoretical literature does not consider social desirability a mere response bias, only 4 of the reviewed articles controlled for the possible suppressor effect of personality variables on social desirability, while the majority focused upon the stylistic (response bias) rather than the substantive (personality) nature of this construct. Conclusion The present review highlighted some limitations in the use of social desirability scales in recent clinical psychology research and tried to offer a few suggestions for handling this issue.},

	shorttitle = {State of deworming coverage and equity in low-income and middle-income countries using household health surveys},
	abstract = {Background
Mass deworming against soil-transmitted helminthiasis, which affects 1 billion of the poorest people globally, is one of the largest public health programmes for neglected tropical diseases, and is intended to be equitable. However, the extent to which treatment programmes for deworming achieve equitable coverage across wealth class and sex is unclear and the public health metric of national deworming coverage does not include representation of equity. This study aims to measure both coverage and equity in global, national, and subnational deworming to guide future programmatic evaluation, investment, and metric design.
Methods
We used nationally representative, geospatial, household data from Demographic and Health Surveys that measured mother-reported deworming in children of preschool age (12–59 months). Deworming was defined as children having received drugs for intestinal parasites in the previous 6 months before the survey. We estimated deworming coverage disaggregated by geography, wealth quintile, and sex, and computed an equity index. We examined trends in coverage and equity index across countries, within countries, and over time. We used a regression model to compute the household correlates of deworming and ecological correlates of equitable deworming.
Findings
Our study included 820 883 children living in 50 countries from Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe that are endemic for soil-transmitted helminthiasis using 77 Demographic and Health Surveys from December, 2003, to October, 2017. In these countries, the mean deworming coverage in preschool children was estimated at 33·0\% (95\% {CI} 32·9–33·1). The subnational coverage ranged from 0·5\% to 87·5\%, and within-country variation was greater than between-country variation. Of the 31 countries reporting that they reached the {WHO} goal of more than 75\% national coverage, 30 had inequity in deworming, with treatment concentrated in wealthier populations. We did not detect systematic differences in deworming equity by sex.
Interpretation
Substantial inequities in mass deworming programmes are common as wealthier populations have consistently higher coverage than that of the poor, including in countries reporting to have reached the {WHO} goal of more than 75\% national coverage. These inequities seem to be geographically heterogeneous, modestly improving over time, with no evidence of sex differences in inequity. Future reporting of deworming coverage should consider disaggregation by geography, wealth, and sex with incorporation of an equity index to complement the conventional public health metric of national deworming coverage.

Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book"--},

	abstract = {An analysis of data from the 2000 Demographic and Health Survey shows that little use is made of antenatal and delivery-care services in rural Haiti. After adjusting for individual-level factors, poor road conditions significantly reduce the likelihood of timely receipt of antenatal care and of four or more antenatal care visits, while the availability of a health centre within 5 kilometres significantly increases the odds of each outcome. The odds of being attended at delivery by trained medical personnel and of institutional delivery are significantly reduced by mountainous terrain and distance from the nearest hospital, and are increased if a health worker providing antenatal care is present in the neighbourhood. Neighbourhood poverty reduces the likelihood of safe delivery care. The findings suggest that improving the use made of maternal healthcare services would require, among other things, improvement of the availability of services and road conditions, and the reduction of poverty.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: This study is based on the 2000 Demographic and Health Survey ({DHS}) conducted in Haiti. Using the {DHS} information on women aged 15 to 49 who had given birth during the three years preceding the survey interview, this study was intended to: (1) examine the determinants of the likelihood of the women using prenatal care in the rural areas and in the urban areas of the country and (2) for the women who made at least one prenatal care visit, examine the determinants of the number of prenatal visits in the rural areas and the urban areas. {METHODS}: The multivariate analysis used logistic models to identify which factors explained the decision to seek prenatal care, and negative binomial models were used to determine how many prenatal visits were conducted by the subgroup of women who did make prenatal care visits. {RESULTS}: Estimated at the mean values of the control variables, the expected probability of using prenatal care services in rural Haiti was 77.16\%, compared to 85.83\% in urban Haiti. Among users of prenatal care services, mothers in rural areas made an expected number of 3.78 prenatal care visits, compared to 5.06 visits for the women in urban areas. {CONCLUSIONS}: A substantial percentage of pregnant women have access to prenatal care services in Haiti, but mothers in rural areas who decided to seek care still fell slightly below the four visits recommended by the World Health Organization. The education levels of both mothers and their partners is a dominant predictor of prenatal care use. Longer travel times and greater distances to health centers in rural areas constituted barriers to repeated visits. Policymakers and health care providers need to take these findings into consideration as they decide on the delivery and management of health care services in Haiti.},

	abstract = {{BackgroundBetween} 2005 and 2050, the human population is forecast to grow by 2.7 billion, with the vast majority of this growth occurring in low income countries. This growth is likely to have significant social, economic and environmental impacts, and make the achievement of international development goals more difficult. The measurement, monitoring and potential mitigation of these impacts require high resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions. In low income countries, however, where the changes will be concentrated, the least information on the distribution of population exists. In this paper we investigate whether satellite imagery in combination with land cover information and census data can be used to create inexpensive, high resolution and easily-updatable settlement and population distribution maps over large areas.Methodology/Principal {FindingsWe} examine various approaches for the production of maps of the East African region (Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania) and where fine resolution census data exists, test the accuracies of map production approaches and existing population distribution products. The results show that combining high resolution census, settlement and land cover information is important in producing accurate population distribution maps.{ConclusionsWe} find that this semi-automated population distribution mapping at unprecedented spatial resolution produces more accurate results than existing products and can be undertaken for as little as \$0.01 per km2. The resulting population maps are a product of the Malaria Atlas Project ({MAP}: http://www.map.ox.ac.uk) and are freely available.},

We examined whether the detrimental impact of this confirmation bias in terms of leading question use was moderated by interviewers' demonstrated ability to adhere to open questions. We classified interviewers' adherence as ‘good’ or ‘poor’ in an independent interview before they interviewed children about a staged event. Half the interviewers were given biassing true and false information about the event; half were given no information. As predicted, only poor interviewers showed the effect of bias. Poor interviewers asked fewer open questions in the biassed condition than the non-biassed condition; good interviewers asked the same (high) proportion of open questions in both conditions. Poor interviewers asked more leading questions in the biassed condition than the non-biassed condition; good interviewers asked the same (low) proportion of leading questions in both conditions.

	abstract = {In his recent writings on the subject of marriage and kinship, Malinowski has repeatedly emphasized what he terms the ‘principle legitimacy’. By this he means the rule, found in all human societies, that a woman has to be married before she is allowed legitimately to conceive. ‘Roughly speaking, an unmarried mother is under a ban, a fatherless child is a bastard. This is by no means only a European or Christian prejudice; it is the attitude found amongst most barbarous and savage peoples as well.’ Where prenuptial intercourse is regarded as illicit and immoral, marriage is obviously the essential prelude to the birth of legitimate children, i.e. children having full social status in the community. But even where prenuptial intercourse is tolerated, this tolerance does not extend to liberty of conception. The unmarried boys and girls may indulge freely in sex, but there must be no issue. An unmarried mother will be subjected to punishment and become the object of scorn, her child possibly killed or aborted, while often the putative father is also penalized unless he marries the girl. Almost universally, a child born out of wedlock has a different status from the legitimate offspring, usually very much to his disadvantage. Facts such as these show that the group of mother and child is considered incomplete in the eyes of the community, and that the sociological position of husband and father is everywhere felt to be indispensable.},

It summarizes the results of an interview-mode experiment conducted with unmarried young women aged 15–21 in which respondents were randomly assigned to either an audio computer-assisted self-interview ({ACASI}) or a conventional face-to-face ({FTF}) interview. In addition, biomarkers were collected for {HIV} and three {STIs}: gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. Prior to collecting the biomarkers, nurses conducted a short face-to-face interview in which they repeated questions about sexual behavior. The study builds on earlier research among adolescents in Kenya where we first investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of {ACASI}. In both Malawi and Kenya, the mode of interviewing and questions about types of sexual partners affect the reporting of sexual activity. Yet the results are not always in accordance with expectations. Reporting for “ever had sex” and “sex with a boyfriend” is higher in the {FTF} mode. When we ask about other partners as well as multiple lifetime partners, however, the reporting is consistently higher with {ACASI}, in many cases significantly so. The {FTF} mode produced more consistent reporting of sexual activity between the main interview and a subsequent interview. The association between infection status and reporting of sexual behavior is stronger in the {FTF} mode, although in both modes a number of young women who denied ever having sex test positive for {STIs}/{HIV}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} African censuses and surveys remain dependent on interviewers for data collection. Data quality is assured through training and supervision. Many survey concepts are difficult to translate into African languages and some, such as “household”, may have multiple criteria which are not fulfilled by everyone, leading interviewers to prioritise different criteria. Some questions introduce unfamiliar ideas which require considerable negotiation by interviewers to obtain acceptable answers. {OBJECTIVE} To identify key stages in the data collection process and domains where interviewer judgement and interviewer-respondent social dynamics play a substantial role in determining who is included in household surveys, and in shaping responses to questions. {METHODS} We analyse published definitions, enumerator manuals and qualitative interview data with households, interviewers, supervisors, trainers, survey organisers and analysts along the chain of data production and use in Tanzania, Uganda, Senegal and Burkina Faso. {RESULTS} Despite comprehensive training manuals and definitions, interviewers influence who is included in, and excluded from surveys. Interviewer versatility needs to include both persuasive social skills and an ability to follow precise wording. In Africa, where survey concepts are often different from local concepts and where interviewers are socio-economically distant from respondents, these persuasive social skills are required throughout the interview process with unknown impact on the data produced. Language diversity is a major barrier to harmonisation. {CONCLUSIONS} To improve survey data validity more effort should be made to understand the influence of interviewers on data in low-income settings. {COMMENTS} This submission covers important issues for demographers undertaking secondary analysis of African surveys, especially those without fieldwork experience.},

This article attempts such a discussion, using data from a longitudinal research study in rural Kenya. It reviews qualitative impressions of insider-and stranger-related issues within the specific Kenyan field setting, drawing primarily on field notes. Relevant areas of social theory and the data collection literature are reviewed briefly. Finally, using the project's longitudinal survey data, empirical tests are presented which allow for an evaluation of differential data quality across insider-and stranger-interviewers on three dimensions: differential response rates, differential reliability of responses, and differential response validity. The results suggest that insider-interviewers increase response rates and collect more consistent data across survey waves. They also suggest that data collected by female insiders in particular appear to be superior for most questions and of equal quality for others.},

	abstract = {Objectives The analysis aimed to assess the scale of interviewer effects on abortion survey responses, to compare interviewer effects between different question wordings and between direct and indirect approaches, and to identify interviewer and interview characteristics that explain interviewer effects on abortion reporting.
Setting 2018 Performance Monitoring for Action nationally representative household surveys from Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria and Rajasthan, India.
Participants Survey data from 20 016 interviews with reproductive age (15–49) women, selected using multistage stratified cluster sampling. Data from self-administered interviewer surveys and from a sample of health service delivery points that serve the female survey participants were also included.
Primary outcome measures Outcomes were the respondent’s own experience of ever ‘removing a pregnancy’, their closest confidante’s experience of pregnancy removal and the respondent’s own experience of period regulation.
Results Substantial interviewer effects were observed, ranging from 7\% in Côte d’Ivoire to 24\% in Nigeria for pregnancy removal. Interviewer effects for survey questions that were designed to ask about abortion in a less stigmatising way were either similar to (9\%–26\% for confidante-reporting) or higher than (17\%–32\% for a question about period regulation) the pregnancy removal question. Interviewer and interview characteristics associated with abortion reporting included respondent–interviewer familiarity, the language of interview and the interviewer’s comfort asking questions about abortion.
Conclusion This study highlights that questions designed to be less stigmatising may increase interviewer effects due to lower comprehension among respondents. Further work is needed to assess question wordings for different contexts. Selecting and training interviewers to ensure comfort asking questions about abortion is important for reproductive health surveys. Challenges for the use of ‘insider’ interviewers and the management of surveys in countries with high linguistic diversity are also identified.},

We showcase the use of {TerraPop} by exploring variations in the climate–migration association in Burkina Faso and Senegal based on differences in the local food security context. Food security was approximated using anthropometric indicators of child stunting and wasting derived from Demographic and Health Surveys and linked to the {TerraPop} extract of climate and migration information. We find that an increase in heat waves was associated with a decrease in international migration from Burkina Faso, while excessive precipitation increased international moves from Senegal. Significant interactions reveal that the adverse effects of heat waves and droughts are strongly amplified in highly food insecure Senegalese departments.},

The Government, in collaboration with developmental partners and agencies, has been strengthening its responses to the {HIV} epidemic to better target the delivery of {HIV} care, treatment strategies and prevention services. Population-based household {HIV} surveys have, over time, contributed to the country’s efforts in monitoring and understanding the magnitude and heterogeneity of the {HIV} epidemic. Local-level monitoring of progress made against {HIV} and {AIDS} is increasingly needed for decision making. Previous studies have provided evidence of substantial subnational variation in the {HIV} epidemic. Using {HIV} prevalence data from the 2016 South African Demographic and Health Survey, we compare three spatial smoothing models, namely, the intrinsically conditionally autoregressive normal, Laplace and skew-t ({ICAR}-normal, {ICAR}-Laplace and {ICAR}-skew-t) in the estimation of the {HIV} prevalence across 52 districts in South Africa. The parameters of the resulting models are estimated using Bayesian approaches. The skewness parameter for the {ICAR}-skew-t model was not statistically significant, suggesting the absence of skewness in the {HIV} prevalence data. Based on the deviance information criterion ({DIC}) model selection, the {ICAR}-normal and {ICAR}-Laplace had {DIC} values of 291.3 and 315, respectively, which were lower than that of the {ICAR}-skewed t (348.1). However, based on the model adequacy criterion using the conditional predictive ordinates ({CPO}), the {ICAR}-skew-t distribution had the lowest {CPO} value. Thus, the {ICAR}-skew-t was the best spatial smoothing model for the estimation of {HIV} prevalence in our study.},

	shorttitle = {The impact of climate change on migration},
	abstract = {Concern about the human impact of climate change has led to predictions of how people living in areas vulnerable to drought, flood, and temperature changes will respond to such events. Early studies warned that climate change would lead to dramatic increases in human migration as households became unable to adapt to the impacts of climate change. More recently, empirical studies focused on observed climate events and trends have documented how migration flows vary as a function of both the severity of the event and the ability of the household to migrate, among other factors. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of this literature, based on a conceptual framework in which climate shocks (e.g., drought, floods, or temperature extremes) affect (a) household capability to migrate, by depleting household resources necessary for migration, and (b) household vulnerability in staying, by increasing the risk that a household falls (further) into poverty. In combination, these factors help explain four key patterns seen in the empirical literature: (1) climate-induced migration is not necessarily more prevalent among poorer households; (2) climate-induced migration tends to be more prevalent for long-distance domestic moves than local or international moves; (3) slow-onset climate changes (such as droughts) are more likely to induce increased migration than rapid-onset changes (such as floods); and (4) the severity of climate shocks impacts migration in a nonlinear fashion, with impacts influenced by whether the capability or vulnerability channel dominates.},

The use of Geographical Information Systems ({GIS}) in investigating the relative importance of geographical factors on utilisation patterns is advocated through a review of published studies and a call made for more research to examine potential relationships with for example health outcomes. Recent advances with regard to the availability of detailed geographically disaggregate data and new location-based techniques such as developments in Global Positioning Systems ({GPS}) hold out great promise in such regards. Finally the policy relevance of such studies is re-iterated in terms of helping to tackle perceived inequities in the system, addressing health inequalities as well as gauging the effectiveness of current and planned service configurations.},

The objective of this scoping review was to conduct an evaluation of studies using spatial statistics approaches for national health survey data in the {SSA} region. An organized literature search for studies related to spatial statistics and national health surveys was conducted through {PMC}, {PubMed}/Medline, Scopus, {NLM} Catalog, and Science Direct electronic databases. Of the 4,193 unique articles identified, 153 were included in the final review. Spatial smoothing and prediction methods were predominant (n = 108), followed by spatial description aggregation (n = 25), and spatial autocorrelation and clustering (n = 19). Bayesian statistics methods and lattice data modelling were predominant (n = 108). Most studies focused on malaria and fever (n = 47) followed by health services coverage (n = 38). Only fifteen studies employed nonstandard spatial analyses (e.g., spatial model assessment, joint spatial modelling, accounting for survey design). We recommend that for future spatial analysis using health survey data in the {SSA} region, there must be an improve recognition and awareness of the potential dangers of a na\&iuml;ve application of spatial statistical methods. We also recommend a wide range of applications using big health data and the future of data science for health systems to monitor and evaluate impacts that are not well understood at local levels.},

Data on schistosomiasis determinants, obtained through literature review, the Philippine Department of Health, and concerned local government units, were standardized and incorporated into a {GIS} map using {ArcGIS}. Data gathered included modifiable [agriculture, poverty, sanitation, presence of intermediate and reservoir hosts, disease prevalence and mass drug administration ({MDA}) coverage] and nonmodifiable (geography and climate) determinants for schistosomiasis. Results showed that most barangays (villages) are characterized by favourable conditions for schistosomiasis transmission which include being located in flood-prone areas, presence of vegetation, low sanitary toilet coverage, presence of snail intermediate host, high carabao (water buffalo) population density, previously reported ≥1\% prevalence using Kato-Katz technique, and low {MDA} coverage. Similarly, barangays not known to be endemic for schistosomiasis but also characterized by the same favourable conditions for schistosomiasis as listed above and may therefore be considered as potentially endemic, even if not being high-risk areas. This study demonstrated the importance of {GIS} technology in characterizing schistosomiasis transmission. Maps generated through application of {GIS} technology are useful in guiding program policy and planning at the local level for an effective and sustainable schistosomiasis control and prevention.},

A child was considered as anaemic if the bloodhaemoglobin count was less than 11.0 g/{dL}.

	abstract = {Spatial weight matrices play a key role in econometrics to capture spatial effects. However, these constructs are prone to clustering and can be challenging to analyse in common statistical packages such as {STATA}. Multiple observations of survey participants in the same location (or cluster) have traditionally not been dealt with appropriately by statistical packages. It is common that participants are assigned Geographic Information System ({GIS}) data at a regional or district level rather than at a small area level. For example, the Demographic Health Survey ({DHS}) generates {GIS} data at a cluster level, such as a regional or district level, rather than providing coordinates for each participant. Moreover, current statistical packages are not suitable for estimating large matrices such as 20,000 × 20,000 (reflective of data within large health surveys) since the statistical package limits the N to a smaller number. In addition, in many cases, {GIS} information is offered at an aggregated level of geographical areas. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a bootstrap approach that generates an inverse distance spatial weight matrix for application in econometric analyses of health survey data. The new approach is illustrated using {DHS} data on uptake of {HIV} testing in low and middle income countries.},

Adjusted versions of these measures are usually estimated by maximum likelihood regression (eg, logistic, Poisson, or Cox modelling). But resulting estimates of effect measures can have serious bias when the data lack adequate case numbers for some combination of exposure and outcome levels. This bias can occur even in quite large datasets and is hence often termed sparse data bias. The bias can arise or be worsened by regression adjustment for potentially confounding variables; in the extreme, the resulting estimates could be impossibly huge or even infinite values that are meaningless artefacts of data sparsity. Such estimate inflation might be obvious in light of background information, but is rarely noted let alone accounted for in research reports.

Yet, there is a lack of conceptual insights on the contextual factors that push individuals to opt for healthy or unhealthy food outlets when both options are accessible. Our comprehension of foodscape influences on dietary behaviours would benefit from a better understanding of the decision-making process for food outlet choices. In this paper, we build on the fundamental position that outlet choices are conditioned by how much outlets’ attributes accommodate individuals’ constraints and preferences. We further argue that food outlets continuously experienced within individuals’ daily-path help people re-evaluate food acquisition possibilities, push them to form intentions, and shape their preferences for the choices they will subsequently make. Doing so, we suggest differentiating access, defined as the potential for the foodscape to be used at the time when individuals decide to do so, from exposure, which acts as a constant catalyst for knowledge, intention, preferences and routine tendency. We conclude with implications for future research, and discuss consequences for public policy.},

However, existing spatially explicit population data across Africa are generally based on outdated, low resolution input demographic data, and provide insufficient detail to quantify rural settlement patterns and, thus, accurately measure population concentration and accessibility. Here we outline approaches to developing a new high resolution population distribution dataset for Africa and analyse rural accessibility to population centers. Contemporary population count data were combined with detailed satellite-derived settlement extents to map population distributions across Africa at a finer spatial resolution than ever before. Substantial heterogeneity in settlement patterns, population concentration and spatial accessibility to major population centres is exhibited across the continent. In Africa, 90\% of the population is concentrated in less than 21\% of the land surface and the average per-person travel time to settlements of more than 50,000 inhabitants is around 3.5 hours, with Central and East Africa displaying the longest average travel times. The analyses highlight large inequities in access, the isolation of many rural populations and the challenges that exist between countries and regions in providing access to services.

For me the parallel is black music, which is as splendid and complicated and wonderful as it is because its audience was within; its primary audience. The fact that it has become universal, worldwide, anyone, everyone can play it, and it has evolved, was because it wasn’t tampered with, and editorialised, within the community. So, I wanted the literature that I wrote to be that way. I could just go straight to where the soil was, where the fertility was in this landscape. And also, I wanted to feel free not to have the white gaze in this place that was so precious to me…

	abstract = {Background:
              The effective performance of hospitals is critical to overall health system goal achievement. Global health system performance frameworks are often used as part of global benchmarking, but not within low and middle-income countries as part of service delivery performance measurement. This study explored the utility of perinatal mortality as a measure of hospital effectiveness.
            
            
              Methods:
              A cross sectional, mixed methods study of six primary referral hospitals, differentiated by ownership, was conducted from 10th June to 9th October 2015. Monthly summary hospital data of maternal delivery services ({MDS}) were abstracted to determine the perinatal mortality. Tests of associations were used to correlate bed turnover, skilled staffing, method of delivery and perinatal mortality. Additionally, 40 questionnaire interviews were held with hospital board members and the management team to assess the availability of standard operating procedures ({SOP}) in {MDS}. Qualitative data was analysed thematically.
            
            
              Results:
              All six hospitals reported having {SOP} in managing {MDS}. The average perinatal mortality rate for all the hospitals was 24.63 per 1,000 live births. However, a perinatal death was 2.6 times more likely in public hospitals compared to private hospitals (29.8 vs 11.4 per 1,000 births respectively). The average caesarean section rate for all hospitals was 25.9\%, but the odds of a caesarean section were 1.67 higher in a private hospital compared to a public hospital (P{\textless}0.001 95\% {CI}: 1.58-1.77). Perinatal mortality was associated with bed turnover ratio (R squared 0.260, P=0.001), and skilled staff availability (R squared 0.064,P{\textless}0.001).
            
            
              Discussion:
              The high perinatal mortality reported in public hospitals may be due to high bed turnover and relatively low caesarean section rate. Input measures of performance such as reporting standards of care and staffing levels are not useful performance indicators. Perinatal mortality as a performance indicator may be an ideal measure of the effectiveness of hospitals.},

	shorttitle = {Updating guidance for reporting systematic reviews},
	abstract = {Objectives
To describe the processes used to update the {PRISMA} 2009 statement for reporting systematic reviews, present results of a survey conducted to inform the update, summarize decisions made at the {PRISMA} update meeting, and describe and justify changes made to the guideline.
Methods
We reviewed 60 documents with reporting guidance for systematic reviews to generate suggested modifications to the {PRISMA} 2009 statement. We invited 220 systematic review methodologists and journal editors to complete a survey about the suggested modifications. The results of these projects were discussed at a 21-member in-person meeting. Following the meeting, we drafted the {PRISMA} 2020 statement and refined it based on feedback from co-authors and a convenience sample of 15 systematic reviewers.
Results
The review of 60 documents revealed that all topics addressed by the {PRISMA} 2009 statement could be modified. Of the 110 survey respondents, more than 66\% recommended keeping six of the original checklist items as they were and modifying 15 of them using wording suggested by us. Attendees at the in-person meeting supported the revised wording for several items but suggested rewording for most to enhance clarity, and further refinements were made over six drafts of the guideline.
Conclusions
The {PRISMA} 2020 statement consists of updated reporting guidance for systematic reviews. We hope that providing this detailed description of the development process will enhance the acceptance and uptake of the guideline and assist those developing and updating future reporting guidelines.},

	abstract = {Primary health care offers a cost–effective route to achieving universal health coverage ({UHC}). However, primary health-care systems are weak in many low- and middle-income countries and often fail to provide comprehensive, people-centred, integrated care. We analysed the primary health-care systems in 20 low- and middle-income countries using a semi-grounded approach. Options for strengthening primary health-care systems were identified by thematic content analysis. We found that: (i) despite the growing burden of noncommunicable disease, many low- and middle-income countries lacked funds for preventive services; (ii) community health workers were often under-resourced, poorly supported and lacked training; (iii) out-of-pocket expenditure exceeded 40\% of total health expenditure in half the countries studied, which affected equity; and (iv) health insurance schemes were hampered by the fragmentation of public and private systems, underfunding, corruption and poor engagement of informal workers. In 14 countries, the private sector was largely unregulated. Moreover, community engagement in primary health care was weak in countries where services were largely privatized. In some countries, decentralization led to the fragmentation of primary health care. Performance improved when financial incentives were linked to regulation and quality improvement, and community involvement was strong. Policy-making should be supported by adequate resources for primary health-care implementation and government spending on primary health care should be increased by at least 1\% of gross domestic product. Devising equity-enhancing financing schemes and improving the accountability of primary health-care management is also needed. Support from primary health-care systems is critical for progress towards {UHC} in the decade to 2030.},

In many countries, health inequalities continue to be a major public health challenge. Furthermore, there is also urbanization that occurs when people move from rural areas to urban areas. It leads to an increase in urban population and the extent of urban areas. Driven by population growth, many cities in low and middle-income countries are growing at record rates which puts large pressure on the healthcare system and facilities. Our research demonstrates that due to many political, economic, social and cultural factors, the current inequalities in health care between regions, urban and rural areas and different age and income groups are increasing. Thence, there is a pressing need for the improvement of the healthcare in the lagged regions and areas using such means as the advanced technologies, analysis of data, as well as targeted funding and assistance to those who need it the most.},

	abstract = {Background: {HIV}/{AIDS} and Tuberculosis ({TB}) are major contributors to the burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa. The two diseases have been described as a harmful synergy as they are biologically and epidemiologically linked. Control of {TB}/{HIV} co-infection is an integral and most challenging part of both national {TB} and national {HIV} control programmes, especially in contexts of instability where health systems are suffering from political and social strife. This study aimed at assessing the provision of {HIV}/{TB} co-infection services in health facilities in the conflict-ridden region of Goma in Democratic Republic of Congo. , 
Methods: A cross-sectional survey of health facilities that provide either {HIV} or {TB} services or both was carried out. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect the data which was analysed using descriptive statistics. , 
Results: Eighty facilities were identified, of which 64 facilities were publicly owned. {TB} care was more available than {HIV} care (in 61\% vs. 9\% of facilities). Twenty-three facilities (29\%) offered services to co-infected patients. {TB}/{HIV} co-infection rates among patients were unknown in 82\% of the facilities. Only 19 facilities (24\%) reported some coordination with and support from concerned diseases’ control programmes. {HIV} and {TB} services are largely fragmented, indicating imbalances and poor coordination by disease control programmes. , 
Conclusion: {HIV} and {TB} control appear not to be the focus of health interventions in this crisis affected region, despite the high risks of {TB} and {HIV} infection in the setting. Comprehensive public health response to this setting calls for reforms that promote joint {TB}/{HIV} co-infection control, including improved leadership by the {HIV} programmes that accuse weaknesses in this conflict-ridden region.},

To describe interviewer-related variability in abuse estimates and assess the nature of the interviewer effects on the associations between elder abuse and covariates.
Study Design and Setting
After intensive training, six interviewers administered structured questionnaires through face-to-face interviews to assess abuse in a population-based sample of 641 Portuguese individuals aged 60–84 years.
Results
The overall prevalence of abuse victimization during the previous year was 28.1\%, but it differed significantly according to the interviewer, ranging from 16.9\% to 36.8\%. There was no statistical effect modification introduced by the interviewer on the association of abuse and its determinants. Additionally, interviewer-level variables (empathy and violence beliefs) showed no significant contribution to explain the variance attributable to potential interviewer effects. Adjusting for the interviewer had little or no effect on the odds ratio of abuse for gender, age, education, and quality of life. However, the interviewer introduced relevant confounding of the associations between abuse and other sensitive topics, such as somatic complaints.
Conclusion
Although no relevant effect modification was observed, this study emphasizes the importance of the interviewer as a relevant confounder when estimating associations between sensitive variables, as it is the case of elder abuse.},

	abstract = {The inequitable geographic distribution of health care resources has long been recognized as a problem in the United States. Traditional measures, such as a simple ratio of supply to demand in an area or distance to the closest provider, are easy measures for spatial accessibility. However the former one does not consider interactions between patients and providers across administrative borders and the latter does not account for the demand side, that is, the competition for the supply. With advancements in {GIS}, however, better measures of geographic accessibility, variants of a gravity model, have been applied. Among them are (1) a two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method and (2) a kernel density ({KD}) method. This microscopic study compared these two {GIS}-based measures of accessibility in our case study of dialysis service centers in Chicago. Our comparison study found a significant mismatch of the accessibility ratios between the two methods. Overall, the 2SFCA method produced better accessibility ratios. There is room for further improvement of the 2SFCA method—varying the radius of service area according to the type of provider or the type of neighborhood and determining the appropriate weight equation form—still warrant further study.},

Methods: A household sample of 142 sexually active African-American youths, 13–19 years old, was questioned about {STD} related stigma (alpha = 0.89), {STD} related shame (alpha = 0.90), and perceptions about disclosure of sexual behaviours to a doctor or nurse (alpha = 0.81).
Results: Among females, stigma was associated with increased anticipation of negative reactions to disclosure of sexual behaviours to a doctor or nurse (odds ratio ({OR}) = 0.319; 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) =0.12 to 0.85) while shame was not. Stigma was also independently associated with {STD} related care seeking in the past year ({OR} = 0.296; 95\% {CI} = 0.09 to 0.94) while shame was not. There was no association between stigma and shame with perceptions about disclosure or past care seeking in males. Perceived outcomes of disclosing sexual behaviours did not moderate the association of stigma, shame, and past {STD} related care seeking.
Conclusions: Stigma about {STDs} may influence how female adolescents perceive reactions to disclosure of their sexual behaviour to healthcare providers. It may also be an important factor in their decision seek to {STD} related care. Perceptions about disclosure of sexual behaviour to a doctor or nurse do not change the relation of stigma or shame to past {STD} related care seeking.},

Sexual activity can expose adolescents to the risks of unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted infections including {HIV}/{AIDS}. This risk is magnified for girls. The objective of the study is to determine the magnitude and correlates of premarital sexual activity among unmarried female adolescents in northern Ethiopia.
Methods
The study employed a cross sectional study design conducted at comprehensive secondary school among unmarried female adolescents in Maichew town, northern Ethiopia. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression.
Results
A total of 624 secondary and preparatory school never married female adolescents were included in this study. About 183 (29.3\%) reported to have started sexual intercourse. Mean age at first sexual intercourse was 16.6 years ({SD} 1.81). About 38\% of the girls reported that they had used condom at their last sexual activity. In multivariable analysis, older age, living with parents, parental residence, elder sister or friends who had started premarital sexual activity, and peer influence, were independently associated with sexual initiation.
Conclusions
The study of this finding clearly demonstrated that rural adolescents initiate sexual activity early with limited protection from infections and unintended pregnancies. Community and school based sexual health education is recommended.},

This study aims to describe patterns of inconsistent reports of sexual intercourse among a sample of South African adolescents.
Methods
Consistency of reported lifetime sexual intercourse was assessed using five semiannual waves of data. Odds ratios related inconsistent reporting to demographic variables and potential indicators of general and risk-behavior–specific reliability problems.
Results
Of the sexually active participants in the sample, nearly 40\% reported being virgins after sexual activity had been reported at an earlier assessment. Inconsistent reporting could not be predicted by gender or race or by general indicators of poor reliability (inconsistent reporting of gender and birth year). However individuals with inconsistent reports of sexual intercourse were more likely to be inconsistent reporters of substance use.
Conclusions
These results suggest that researchers need to undertake efforts to deal specifically with inconsistent risk behavior data. These may include modification of data collection procedures and use of statistical methodologies that can account for response inconsistencies.},

	shorttitle = {Social Desirability Bias in Sexual Behavior Reporting},
	abstract = {{CONTEXT}
Social desirability bias is problematic in studies that rely on self-reported sexual behavior data. Where gender norms create different expectations about socially acceptable behavior, males and females face distinct pressures in reporting certain outcomes, which can distort assessments of risk for {HIV} and {STIs}.

{METHODS}
In 2009, relationship and sexual behavior data were collected from 1,750 never-married males and females aged 16–18 via audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (audio-{CASI}) during the third round of the Malawi Schooling and Adolescent Study. A comparison group of 311 youth completed an identical questionnaire in face-to-face interviews. To assess whether interview mode may have influenced participants’ reporting of sensitive behavior, reports of sexual experience in the two groups were compared. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify associations between interview mode and reports of these behaviors, by gender.

{RESULTS}
In adjusted regression models, males were less likely to report ever having had a girlfriend in audio-{CASI} than in face-to-face interviews (odds ratio, 0.4), but they were more likely to report having had sex with a relative or teacher (3.5). For females, reports of ever having had a boyfriend or having had sex did not differ between modes. A small proportion of females reported ever having had sex with a relative or teacher in audio-{CASI}, while none did so in face-to-face interviews.

{CONCLUSIONS}
The method used for collecting relationship and sexual behavior data may influence the reported prevalence of some key behaviors, particularly among males. Further research is needed to improve methods of collecting sensitive data.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Accurate and reliable data on the prevalence of adolescents' sexual behavior are paramount for effective sexual and reproductive health intervention. Adolescents' sexual behavior has been widely studied. However, scholars have raised concerns about the accuracy and reliability of self-reported sexual behavior by adolescents. Previous research shows high levels of adolescent sexual activity in urban informal settlements; yet, the accuracy of self-reported sexual experience in these settings is understudied.
Methods
The objective of this article is to assess consistency of self-reported sexual activity among 2324 adolescents living in slum and nonslum settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. We examine two forms of inconsistencies, namely, what we term “reborn virgins” and inconsistent timing of sexual debut, during two rounds of survey. Factors influencing inconsistent reporting are explored through logistic regression.
Results
A total of 469 (20\%) adolescents gave inconsistent information on whether they have ever had sex (n = 190) or timing of first intercourse (n = 279). Males, slum residents, and adolescents attending school were more likely to give inconsistent sexual information. Among inconsistent reporters, slum residents, adolescents reporting substance use, and those with secondary (vs. primary) education were more likely to reclaim virginity status than to misreport the timing of first sex. However, older adolescents were less likely to reclaim virginity status.
Conclusions
We found significant differences between adolescents who provide consistent reports and those who misreport sexual behavior data. We argue that researchers should account for biases stemming from misreporting of sensitive information among young people and, in particular, should be cognizant of how reporting quality may vary across demographic groups.},

Because key data and information platforms employ different measurement approaches—namely, different definitions of sexual recency—reports of contraceptive prevalence and unmet need among unmarried women are inconsistent. We examine how the measurement approaches employed by 3 large organizations yield such divergent estimates. We find that contraceptive prevalence and unmet need estimates among married women do not vary much by sexual recency. For unmarried women, contraceptive prevalence is systematically lower and unmet need is systematically higher as the sexual recency window widens. In the short term, we recommend using the 1-month cutoff as analyses reveal it yields the most precise estimates for better recognizing the needs of this important demographic group.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Obesity rates are recognized to be at epidemic levels throughout much of the world, posing significant threats to both the health and financial security of many nations. The causes of obesity can vary but are often complex and multifactorial, and while many contributing factors can be targeted for intervention, an understanding of where these interventions are needed is necessary in order to implement effective policy. This has prompted an interest in incorporating spatial context into the analysis and modeling of obesity determinants, especially through the use of geographically weighted regression ({GWR}).
            
            
              Method
              This paper provides a critical review of previous {GWR} models of obesogenic processes and then presents a novel application of multiscale (M){GWR} using the Phoenix metropolitan area as a case study.
            
            
              Results
              
                Though the {MGWR} model consumes more degrees of freedom than {OLS}, it consumes far fewer degrees of freedom than {GWR}, ultimately resulting in a more nuanced analysis that can incorporate spatial context but does not force every relationship to become local
                a priori
                . In addition, {MGWR} yields a lower {AIC} and {AICc} value than {GWR} and is also less prone to issues of multicollinearity. Consequently, {MGWR} is able to improve our understanding of the factors that influence obesity rates by providing determinant-specific spatial contexts.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              The results show that a mix of global and local processes are able to best model obesity rates and that {MGWR} provides a richer yet more parsimonious quantitative representation of obesity rate determinants compared to both {GWR} and ordinary least squares.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background 
              Life expectancy at birth ({LEB}), one of the main indicators of human longevity, has often been used to characterise the health status of a population. Understanding its relationships with the deprivation is key to develop policies and evaluate interventions that are aimed at reducing health inequalities. However, methodological challenges in the analysis of {LEB} data arise from the fact that different Government agencies often provide spatially aggregated information on {LEB} and the index of multiple deprivation ({IMD}) at different spatial scales. Our objective is to develop a geostatistical framework that, unlike existing methods of inference, allows to carry out spatially continuous prediction while dealing with spatial misalignment of the areal-level data.
            
            
              Methods 
              We developed a model-based geostatistical approach for the joint analysis of {LEB} and {IMD}, when these are available over different partitions of the study region. We model the spatial correlation in {LEB} and {IMD} across the areal units using inter-point distances based on a regular grid covering the whole of the study area. The advantages and strengths of the new methodology are illustrated through an analysis of {LEB} and {IMD} data from the Liverpool district council.
            
            
              Results 
              We found that the effect of {IMD} on {LEB} is stronger in males than in females, explaining about 63.35\% of the spatial variation in {LEB} in the former group and 38.92\% in the latter. We also estimate that {LEB} is about 8.5 years lower between the most and least deprived area of Liverpool for men, and 7.1 years for women. Finally, we find that {LEB}, both in males and females, is at least 80\% likely to be above the England wide average only in some areas falling in the electoral wards of Childwall, Woolton and Church.
            
            
              Conclusion 
              The novel model-based geostatistical framework provides a feasible solution to the spatial misalignment problem. More importantly, the proposed methodology has the following advantages over existing methods used model {LEB}: (1) it can deliver spatially continuous inferences using spatially aggregated data; (2) it can be applied to any form of misalignment with information provided at a range of spatial scales, from areal-level to pixel-level.},

There is an emerging link between air pollution, which is ubiquitous in our environment, particularly in urban centers, and incident childhood asthma.

We reported comparisons of asthma incidence under each hypothetical air pollution intervention with incidence under the observed natural course of exposure; results that may be more tangible for policymakers compared with risk ratios.

              Background
              Ecologic health studies often rely on outcomes from health service utilization data that are limited by relatively coarse spatial resolutions and missing geographic information, particularly neighborhood level identifiers. When fine-scale geographic data are missing, the ramifications and strategies for addressing them are not well researched or developed. This study illustrates a novel spatio-temporal framework that combines a geographic identifier assignment (i.e., geographic imputation) algorithm with predictive Bayesian variable selection to identify neighborhood factors associated with disparities in emergency department ({ED}) visits for asthma.
            
            
              Methods
              {ED} visit records with missing fine-scale spatial identifiers ({\textasciitilde} 20\%) were geocoded using information from known, coarser, misaligned spatial units using an innovative geographic identifier assignment algorithm. We then employed systematic variable selection in a spatio-temporal Bayesian hierarchical model ({BHM}) predictive framework within the {NIMBLE} package in R. Our novel methodology is illustrated in an ecologic case study aimed at identifying neighborhood-level predictors of asthma {ED} visits in South Carolina, United States, from 1999 to 2015. The health outcome was annual {ED} visit counts in small areas (i.e., census tracts) with primary diagnoses of asthma ({ICD}9 codes 493.{XX}) among children ages 5 to 19 years.
            
            
              Results
              We maintained 96\% of {ED} visit records for this analysis. When the algorithm used areal proportions as probabilities for assignment, which addressed differential missingness of census tract identifiers in rural areas, variable selection consistently identified significant neighborhood-level predictors of asthma {ED} visit risk including pharmacy proximity, average household size, and carbon monoxide interactions. Contrasted with common solutions of removing geographically incomplete records or scaling up analyses, our methodology identified critical differences in parameters estimated, predictors selected, and inferences. We posit that the differences were attributable to improved data resolution, resulting in greater power and less bias. Importantly, without this methodology, we would have inaccurately identified predictors of risk for asthma {ED} visits, particularly in rural areas.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our approach innovatively addressed several issues in ecologic health studies, including missing small-area geographic information, multiple correlated neighborhood covariates, and multiscale unmeasured confounding factors. Our methodology could be widely applied to other small-area studies, useful to a range of researchers throughout the world.},

Of principal interest to survey practitioners are interviewer attributes associated with higher cooperation rates, particularly among sample members whose characteristics are traditionally associated with a lower probability of response. Our data source is unusually rich, in that it contains extensive information on interviewers, including their attitudes and behaviors, which are linked to detailed information on both responding and nonresponding sample units. An important value of the data is that they permit examining a host of as yet unanswered questions about whether some interviewer attributes stimulate cooperation among some respondents but not others. In short, we investigate whether some sample units react favorably to certain interviewer characteristics. A multilevel cross-classified logistic model with random interviewer effects is used to account for clustering of households within interviewers, due to unmeasured interviewer attributes, and for the cross-classification of interviewers within areas. The model allows for statistical interactions between interviewer and household characteristics.We find that interviewer confidence and attitudes toward persuading reluctant respondents play an important role in explaining between-interviewer variation in refusal rates. We also find evidence of interaction effects between the interviewer and householder, for example with respect to gender and educational level, supporting the notion of similarity between interviewers and respondents generating higher cooperation. The results are discussed with respect to potential implications for survey practice and design.},

It is unclear how much interpenetration is needed for a cross-classified multilevel model to work well and to estimate the two higher-level effects reliably.

The effects of different membership allocation schemes, total sample sizes, group sizes, number of groups, overall rates of response and the variance partitioning coefficient on the properties of the estimators and the power of the Wald test are considered. The work is motivated by an application to separate area and interviewer effects on survey non-response which are often confounded. The results indicate that limited interviewer dispersion (around three areas per interviewer) provides sufficient interpenetration for good estimator properties. Further dispersion yields only very small or negligible gains in the properties. Interviewer dispersion also acts as a moderating factor on the effect of the other simulation factors (sample size, the ratio of interviewers to areas, the overall probability and the variance values) on the properties of the estimators and test statistics. The results also indicate that a higher number of interviewers for a set number of areas and a set total sample size improves these properties.},

This paper defines interviewer effects, argues for the importance of measuring and controlling for interviewer effects in health surveys, provides advice about how to interpret research on interviewer effects and summarizes research to date on race, ethnicity and gender effects. Interviewer effects appear to be most likely to occur when survey items query attitudes about sociodemographic characteristics or respondents’ engagement in sensitive behaviors such as substance use. However, there is surprisingly little evidence to indicate whether sociodemographic interviewer–respondent matching improves survey response rates or data validity, and the use of a matched design introduces possible measurement bias across studies. Additional research is needed to elucidate many issues, including the influence of interviewers’ sociodemographic characteristics on health-related topics, the role of within-group interviewer variability on survey data and the simultaneous impact of multiple interviewer characteristics. The findings of such research would provide much-needed guidance to public health professionals on whether or not to match interviewers and respondents on key sociodemographic characteristics.},

Several design features of the survey procedure have been suggested to counteract this problem; particularly, computerized surveys are supposed to elicit more truthful responding. This assumption was tested in a meta-analysis of survey experiments reporting 460 effect sizes (total N =125,672). Self-reported prevalence rates of several sensitive behaviors for which motivated misreporting has been frequently observed were compared across self-administered paper-and-pencil versus computerized surveys. The results revealed that computerized surveys led to significantly more reporting of socially undesirable behaviors than comparable surveys administered on paper. This effect was strongest for highly sensitive behaviors and surveys administered individually to respondents. Moderator analyses did not identify interviewer effects or benefits of audio-enhanced computer surveys. The meta-analysis highlighted the advantages of computerized survey modes for the assessment of sensitive topics.},

The introduction of the fieldworker survey to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey provides
the first opportunity to test associations between interviewer characteristics and the reporting of intimate partner violence in the largest source of {IPV} data on intimate partner violence available for low- and middle-income countries. Three separate, multilevel logistic regression models
were used to examine associations between the reporting of physical, sexual and emotional intimate partner violence and interviewer characteristics (age, sex and marital status, as well as differences in these indicators between interviewer and respondent), language of the interview and the
interviewer’s previous experience conducting the Demographic and Health Survey. Previous experience as a Demographic and Health Survey interviewer was associated with significantly lower odds ({OR}: 0.67) of reporting physical intimate partner violence. Researchers should consider using
the fieldworker data set in future studies to control for potential interviewer error, account for the clustering of data by interviewer and increase the robustness of Demographic and Health Survey analyses. Understanding how interviewers may shape the reporting of intimate partner violence
is a step towards accurately measuring its burden in low- and middle-income countries.},

This thesis aims to reveal profiles of data collection staff candidates involved 
in 2013 Turkey Demographic and Health Survey ({TDHS}-2013) recruitment process. 
This process consisted of different stages, in which the candidates filled in various 
forms. In order to reach the aim of this study, a special data set named “{TDHS}-2013 
Data Collection Staff data” (hereafter, “staff data set”) was constructed using these 
forms. Descriptive analyses are carried out using nationally representative household 
and women data sets from the {TDHS}-2013 along with the staff data set. Moreover, pre 
and post processes of the fieldwork are compared by means of certain information 
obtained from recruitment forms. Furthermore, effects of interviewer characteristics 
on both number of completed interviews and interviewer performance are considered. 
Additionally, results of interviews, response rates and completion rates, along with 
sample provinces and assignments of the staff, are evaluated on the basis of data 
collection staff for household interviews and women interviews. 
Results indicate that information on the candidates should be gathered fully 
and kept updated to carry out further analyses in detail. The constructed staff data set 
let us examine the profiles of all applicants for the {TDHS}-2013 fieldwork, and evaluate 
the relation between interviewer characteristics and their performances. However, the 
constructed staff data set with the available information of interviewers was not 
suitable to make assessments regarding the attitudes, behaviors, and expectations of 
interviewers. Additionally, calculated calendar ratios on displacement of child birth 
dates imply that there is a potential interview bias on child birth date information. We 
expect this study will be a starting point for further studies analyzing interviewer 
profile, and investigating for a relation between data collection staff and survey 
estimates.},

            Responses to survey questions about abortion are affected by a wide range of factors, including stigma, fear, and cultural norms. However, we know little about how interviewers might affect responses to survey questions on abortion. The aim of this study is to assess how interviewers affect the probability of women reporting abortions in nationally representative household surveys: Demographic and Health Surveys ({DHS}). We use cross-classified random intercepts at the level of the interviewer and the sampling cluster in a Bayesian framework to analyze the impact of interviewers on the probability of reporting abortions in 22 {DHS} conducted worldwide. Household surveys are the only available data we can use to study the determinants and pathways of abortion in detail and in a representative manner. Our analyses are motivated by improving our understanding of the reliability of these data. Results show an interviewer effect accounting for between 0.2\% and 50\% of the variance in the odds of a woman reporting ever having had an abortion, after women's demographic characteristics are controlled for. In contrast, sampling cluster effects are much lower in magnitude. Our findings suggest the need for additional effort in assessing the causes of abortion underreporting in household surveys, including interviewers' skills and characteristics. This study also has important implications for improving the collection of other sensitive demographic data (e.g., gender-based violence and sexual health). Data quality of responses to sensitive questions could be improved with more attention to interviewers—their recruitment, training, and characteristics. Future analyses will need to account for the role of interviewer to more fully understand possible data biases.},

A total of 11,537 diarrheal cases were reported. Thirty-nine water sources were evaluated. A computer modeling approach called probabilistic layer analysis ({PLA}) spatially displayed the water source at layers of geology, hydrology, population, environmental pollution, and electricity according to a color-coded five-point ranking. The water sources were categorized into A, B, and C based on the cumulative scores {\textless} 10 for A, 10-19 for B, and {\textgreater} 19 for C. T-test showed revealed significant differences in diarrheal disease incidence between categories A, B, and C with mean +/- {SEM} values of 1.612 +/- 0.325, 6.257 +/- 0.408, and 15.608 +/- 2.151, respectively.

Existing work considers the planning problem as either selecting new sites or adjusting facility capacities, separately. This paper develops a two-step hybrid approach to the problem by optimizing both locations and capacities of facilities towards equal accessibility. A genetic algorithm is first employed to find the best locations to site new facilities, and then a quadratic programming method is used to determine the best capacity of each facility within a pre-defined range. The sequence is consistent with many decision-making practices. Results of a series of experiments demonstrate that location optimization reduces inequality in accessibility more significantly than capacity optimization. The two-step optimization method can be applied for sequential allocation decision-makings towards maximum equal accessibility.},

The former is a special case of the latter. Based on the 2000 Census and primary care physician data, this research assesses the variation of spatial accessibility to primary care in the Chicago region, and analyzes the sensitivity of results by experimenting with ranges of threshold travel times in the {FCA} method and travel friction coefficients in the gravity model.

	abstract = {Objectives Malaria risk maps have re-emerged as an important tool for appropriately targeting the limited resources available for malaria control. In Sub-Saharan Africa empirically derived maps using standardized criteria are few and this paper considers the development of a model of malaria risk for East Africa. Methods Statistical techniques were applied to high spatial resolution remotely sensed, human settlement and land-use data to predict the intensity of malaria transmission as defined according to the childhood parasite ratio ({PR}) in East Africa. Discriminant analysis was used to train environmental and human settlement predictor variables to distinguish between four classes of {PR} risk shown to relate to disease outcomes in the region. Results Independent empirical estimates of the {PR} were identified from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda (n = 330). Surrogate markers of climate recorded on-board earth orbiting satellites, population settlement, elevation and water bodies all contributed significantly to the predictive models of malaria transmission intensity in the sub-region. The accuracy of the model was increased by stratifying East Africa into two ecological zones. In addition, the inclusion of urbanization as a predictor of malaria prevalence, whilst reducing formal accuracy statistics, nevertheless improved the consistency of the predictive map with expert opinion malaria maps. The overall accuracy achieved with ecological zone and urban stratification was 62\% with surrogates of precipitation and temperature being among the most discriminating predictors of the {PR}. Conclusions It is possible to achieve a high degree of predictive accuracy for Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence in East Africa using high-spatial resolution environmental data. However, discrepancies were evident from mapped outputs from the models which were largely due to poor coverage of malaria training data and the comparable spatial resolution of predictor data. These deficiencies will only be addressed by more random, intensive small areas studies of empirical estimates of {PR}.},
